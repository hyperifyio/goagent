# CI quality gates

This repository enforces reproducible builds, formatting, lint, static analysis, tests, and path hygiene via the Makefile and GitHub Actions.

- Timeouts:
  - HTTP requests use `-http-timeout` (can be set via `OAI_HTTP_TIMEOUT` in CI). Keep between 60â€“120s unless tests require less.
  - Tools use `-tool-timeout`, with per-tool `timeoutSec` in `tools.json` taking precedence.
- Lint:
  - `make lint` runs the Go toolchain version gate first via `make check-go-version`, then executes lint, vet, formatting checks, and path hygiene checks (`make check-tools-paths` and `make verify-manifest-paths`).
  - Expected log excerpt when versions match: `check-go-version: OK (system X.Y matches go.mod X.Y)`.
- Tests: `go test ./...` run offline with fakes; integration tests exercise tool invocation end-to-end.
- Reproducible builds: `make build build-tools` with `-trimpath` and stripped ldflags; artifacts ignored by Git.

In test scenarios that validate timeouts, prefer small values and deterministic sleeps in fakes to keep CI fast. Ensure such tests are isolated and do not introduce flakiness.
