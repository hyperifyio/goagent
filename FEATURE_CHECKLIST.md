* [x] Initialize repo with Go module and scaffolding: run `mkdir agentcli && cd agentcli && git init && go mod init github.com/<org>/agentcli`; add `LICENSE` (MIT), `README.md` (purpose, usage, examples), `.gitignore` (bin/, dist/, .DS_Store, go.work, .idea, .vscode); create directories `cmd/agentcli`, `internal/oai`, `internal/tools`, `docs/adr`, `docs/diagrams`; set default model id `oss-gpt-20b` and default OpenAI-compatible base URL `https://api.openai.com/v1` to be read from env or flags.
* [x] Implement `cmd/agentcli/main.go` non-interactive run loop: `package main` with `main()` reading flags, building initial messages `[system,user]`, calling the HTTP client, executing any returned tool calls, appending tool results as `role=tool` messages, repeating until the model returns a final assistant message with text, then printing to stdout and exiting 0; all failures print a concise error to stderr and exit non-zero (2 for CLI misuse like missing `-prompt`, 1 otherwise).
* [x] Implement full CLI flag set with defaults and env fallbacks: `-prompt (string, required)`, `-tools (path to tools.json, optional)`, `-system (string, default "You are a helpful, precise assistant. Use tools when strictly helpful.")`, `-base-url (string, default env OAI_BASE_URL or https://api.openai.com/v1)`, `-api-key (string, default env OAI_API_KEY)`, `-model (string, default env OAI_MODEL or oss-gpt-20b)`, `-max-steps (int, default 8)`, `-timeout (duration, default 30s, applies to HTTP and tool exec unless tool overrides)`, `-temp (float64, default 0.2)`, `-debug (bool, default false, dumps request/response JSON to stderr)`; precedence: flag > env > hard default; validate `-prompt` non-empty before running.
* [x] Implement OpenAI-compatible client (POST `/v1/chat/completions`): define request types `{model, messages[], tools[], tool_choice:"auto", temperature}` and response types `{choices[].message{role,content,tool_calls[]}, choices[].finish_reason}`; send `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` if provided; `Content-Type: application/json`; use `http.Client{Timeout: <timeout>}`; treat any non-2xx as error with body included; support `finish_reason` but not required to stop if you already have final content; never stream in MVP.
* [x] Wire default config for oss-gpt-20b: honor `OAI_MODEL=oss-gpt-20b`, `OAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1`, and `OAI_API_KEY=<token>`; document that any OpenAI-compatible endpoint can be used by changing `-base-url` and `-model`; ensure no hard dependency on OpenAI SDKs (pure net/http).
* [x] Implement tool manifest loader `internal/tools/manifest.go`: load `tools.json`; schema per tool `{ "name": string (required, unique), "description": string, "schema": object (JSON Schema for params), "command": [string,...] (argv, required), "timeoutSec": int (optional per-call) }`; validate: name non-empty, command len>=1, names unique; build a registry `map[string]ToolSpec` and an OpenAI “tools” array `[{type:"function", function:{name,description,parameters}}]`; return both; on parse/validation error, fail fast with clear message including tool name.
* [x] Implement secure tool runner `internal/tools/runner.go`: execute tools via `exec.CommandContext(ctx, argv[0], argv[1:]...)`; pass function arguments string verbatim to tool stdin (JSON), capture stdout (string) and stderr; apply timeout: prefer per-tool `timeoutSec`, else global `-timeout`; scrub environment to a minimal allowlist (PATH and HOME only); never invoke a shell; return stdout as the tool result string; on timeout return error "tool timed out", on non-zero exit return error including stderr snippet.
* [x] Implement assistant tool-call loop in `main.go`: request includes `tool_choice:"auto"` and declared tools; when assistant message contains `tool_calls`, iterate each call with `type:"function"`, find spec by `function.name`; if unknown, synthesize a tool result `{"error":"unknown tool <name>"}`; for each executed call, append a message `{role:"tool", name:<function.name>, tool_call_id:<id>, content:<tool stdout or error JSON>}`; then immediately call the API again with the extended transcript; stop when assistant returns content and zero tool_calls; print content to stdout.
* [x] Map tool failures deterministically to JSON error content: on any runner error, set tool message content to a single-line JSON `{"error":"<sanitized message>"}` where message is JSON-escaped and truncated (e.g., to 1k chars) to avoid prompt bloat; do not exit on individual tool errors—let the model decide recovery; only exit non-zero if the overall run loop ends without producing final assistant text or if the HTTP call fails.
* [x] Provide example tool `tools/get_time.go` and build instructions: implements `stdin` JSON `{"tz":"Europe/Helsinki"}` (default `"UTC"` if omitted); outputs single-line JSON `{"tz":"...","iso":"RFC3339","unix":<seconds>}` to stdout; returns exit code 0 on success; build with `go build -o tools/get_time ./tools/get_time.go`; usage example prompt: “What’s the local time in Helsinki? If tools are available, call get_time.”; confirm tool respects `TZ` value strictly via `time.LoadLocation`.
* [x] Provide example `tools.json` colocated at repo root: `{ "tools":[ { "name":"get_time", "description":"Get current time for an IANA timezone", "schema":{ "type":"object", "properties":{ "tz":{"type":"string","description":"IANA timezone, e.g. Europe/Helsinki"} }, "required":["tz"], "additionalProperties":false }, "command":["./tools/get_time"], "timeoutSec":5 } ] }`; document that `command` is relative to the working directory of `agentcli`.
* [x] Add build targets: root `Makefile` with `build: go build -o bin/agentcli ./cmd/agentcli`, `build-tools: go build -o tools/get_time ./tools/get_time.go`, `lint`, `test`, `clean`; ensure `CGO_ENABLED=0` for reproducible static binaries; support `GOOS`/`GOARCH` overrides for cross-compilation; add `bin/` and built tools to `.gitignore`.
* [x] Write README quickstart that is fully runnable: prerequisites (Go 1.21+), `make build build-tools`, export `OAI_BASE_URL`, `OAI_MODEL=oss-gpt-20b`, `OAI_API_KEY` if required, then run `./bin/agentcli -prompt "What's the local time in Helsinki? Use get_time." -tools ./tools.json -debug`; explain expected behavior (model triggers function call, tool prints JSON, agent posts back, model replies with final text), and show sample output line and non-zero exit behavior on errors.
* [x] Add ADR-0001 documenting architecture and protocol: create `docs/adr/0001-minimal-agent-cli.md` containing context (non-interactive CLI agent with OpenAI-compatible API and local tools), options considered (Go vs Python vs local inference), decision (Go + Chat Completions tools + argv tools), rationale (static binary, process control, vendor-agnostic), consequences (no streaming in MVP, single-threaded tool calls), and a link to the canonical GitHub issue; include explicit contracts for CLI flags and tool I/O in the ADR.
* [x] Add Mermaid sequence diagram kept in repo: `docs/diagrams/agentcli-seq.md` with a `sequenceDiagram` that shows CLI → API → tool → API → final response; reference this file from both `README.md` and ADR-0001; require updates to diagram in any PR that changes the loop or message flow.
* [x] Implement unit tests (deterministic) for manifest, runner, and client: `internal/tools/manifest_test.go` verifies invalid/missing fields and uniqueness errors; `internal/tools/runner_test.go` includes a helper tool binary that sleeps to trigger timeout and asserts `"tool timed out"` mapping; `internal/oai/client_test.go` uses `httptest.Server` to return 500 and asserts error includes status and body; tests must run offline and pass on `go test ./...`.
* [x] Implement conversation-loop test using `httptest.Server` and a fake tool: server step 1 responds with assistant message containing `tool_calls=[{id:"1",type:"function",function:{name:"echo",arguments:"{\"text\":\"hi\"}"}}]`; fake tool reads stdin `{"text":"hi"}` and prints `{"echo":"hi"}`; server step 2 returns final assistant message `"done"`; run `agentcli` main via a small wrapper (or extract loop into testable function) and assert stdout equals `"done\n"` and exit code 0.
* [x] Document security posture and trust boundaries in README: tools are an explicit allowlist (`tools.json`); no shell invocation (argv only); stdin/stdout JSON contract; per-call timeouts; minimal environment; recommend running untrusted tools under containment (container/jail/user namespace) and setting a working directory with restricted permissions; clarify that the model is untrusted input—never pass its arguments to a shell; state that secrets must be supplied via env/CI secrets and never committed.
* [x] Output an error if any configured tool is missing and unavailable
* [x] Improve .cursor/rules/work-on-features.mdc to instruct that files must be deleted using `git rm ...` command

* [x] Teach the CLI to accept OPENAI_API_KEY as a fallback when OAI_API_KEY is unset to improve compatibility with existing environments and scripts while keeping OAI_API_KEY canonical in docs, smallest change is adding an env fallback in cmd/agentcli/main.go only; scope CLI; low risk; DoD includes a focused unit test for env resolution precedence (flag > OAI_API_KEY > OPENAI_API_KEY > default), tests otherwise unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security scanning and secret detection) with no new findings, peer review completed, verification by running the CLI with only OPENAI_API_KEY set and observing the Authorization header present, rollback by reverting the change.
* [x] Normalize environment variable names across scripts to prefer OAI_BASE_URL and OAI_MODEL with fallback from existing LLM_BASE_URL so users have one canonical set while keeping compatibility, smallest change is editing scripts to read OAI variables first with LLM fallbacks and adjusting README wording, scope scripts and docs, low risk; DoD includes running smoke and health scripts with only OAI_* set and observing success, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by executing the scripts locally, rollback by reverting the edits.
  - [x] [S01:l98-submodule-update] Update `scripts` submodule to modify `wait-for-health.sh` and `smoke-test.sh` to prefer `OAI_*` with `LLM_*` fallback; commit in submodule and bump superproject pointer.
* [x] Unify tool hierarchy so each tool’s binary is in ./tools/bin/NAME, source in ./tools/cmd/NAME/NAME.go, and tests in ./tools/cmd/NAME/NAME_test.go, updating Makefile, tools.json, documentation, tests, and all other affected places to use a consistent unique naming format.
  - [x] [S01:l90-make-bin-outputs] Update `Makefile` to emit binaries under `tools/bin/NAME` while keeping legacy outputs for transition; tests green.
  - [x] [S54:l90-lint-wire-path-guard] Amend `Makefile` `lint` target to invoke `$(MAKE) check-tools-paths` after golangci-lint/vet/format so path hygiene is enforced locally and in CI; DoD: running `make lint` on current branch fails due to legacy `./tools/<name>` references and passes after migration slices, scope limited to `Makefile`, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S54a:l90-unblock-tests-legacy-dirs] Unblock S54 by restoring legacy tool source dirs expected by tests (e.g., `tools/exec`, `tools/fs_write_file`, `tools/fs_append_file`, ...), or adjust tests to current layout so `go test ./...` is green before committing S54.
  - [x] [S55:l90-guard-single-file-builds] Extend `check-tools-paths` (Makefile) to also fail on single-file or direct tool builds outside the canonical layout using a search like `rg -n '(\./tools/[a-z_]+\.go|go\s+(build|run)\s+.*\./tools/[a-z_]+)' -g '!tools/cmd/**' -g '!tools/bin/**' -g '!FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md'` across the repo; DoD: `make check-tools-paths` fails before migration and passes after, no behavior changes elsewhere.
  - [x] [S56:l90-runbook-windows-examples] Update `docs/runbooks/troubleshooting.md` examples to include Windows variants using `./tools/bin/NAME.exe` alongside Unix `./tools/bin/NAME` so users on Windows can follow identical steps; DoD: doc renders on GitHub, and `rg -n '\.exe' docs/runbooks/troubleshooting.md` finds at least one tool invocation; tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S57:l90-manifest-doc-errors] Document new validator errors in `docs/reference/tools-manifest.md` under “Common mistakes” (messages for relative `command[0]` not starting with `./tools/bin/` and for normalized escapes like `./tools/bin/../hack`), aligning wording with `internal/tools/manifest.go`; DoD: docs render, and `rg -n 'start with \\./tools/bin|escapes \\./tools/bin' docs/reference/tools-manifest.md` matches; tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S49:l90-windows-bin-extensions] Update `Makefile` `build-tools` and `clean` recipes to emit `.exe` suffix when `GOOS=windows` for all binaries under `tools/bin/NAME(.exe)` and to remove them on `make clean`; verify by `GOOS=windows make build-tools` producing `tools/bin/{get_time,exec,fs_*}.exe` and `make clean` leaving `git status` clean; DoD: commands reproducible on Linux/macOS cross-compiling to Windows, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S50:l90-docs-windows-exe] Document OS-specific binary names in `docs/reference/tools-manifest.md` and `README.md` (Quick start and tool examples): require relative `command[0]` to use `./tools/bin/NAME` on Unix and `./tools/bin/NAME.exe` on Windows, with a short note and dual JSON examples; DoD: docs render on GitHub, `rg "\.\/tools\/bin\/.*\.exe" -n README.md docs/reference/tools-manifest.md` finds at least one Windows example, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S51:l90-guard-no-legacy-paths] Add a `Makefile` target `check-tools-paths` that fails if any `./tools/(get_time|fs_|exec)` invocation remains outside `tools/bin` or `tools/cmd` (excluding `FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md`); implement with `rg` and negative globs; DoD: `make check-tools-paths` passes after migration, and fails before when run on current branch; no code behavior changed.
  - [x] [S52:l90-manifest-escape-check] Harden `internal/tools/manifest.go` validation to reject relative `command[0]` that normalize (via `path.Clean` + `filepath.ToSlash`) to paths containing `..` segments or escaping `./tools/bin/` (e.g., `./tools/bin/../hack`), and add focused tests in `internal/tools/manifest_test.go`; DoD: new tests fail before change and pass after, `go test ./...` green across platforms.
  - [x] [S53:l90-buildtool-windows-suffix-test] Extend `tools/testutil/buildtool.go` (after [S29:l90-test-helper-buildtool]) with a unit test asserting the returned binary path ends with `.exe` when `runtime.GOOS == "windows"` and has no suffix otherwise; migrate one representative tool test to assert the suffix via `BuildTool`; DoD: `go test ./tools/...` green on Unix and Windows runners when available.
  - [x] [S30:l90-manifest-enforce-bin-prefix] Enforce in `internal/tools/manifest.go` that any relative `command[0]` starts with `./tools/bin/` (absolute paths allowed for tests); adapt existing tests under `internal/tools/manifest_test.go` to cover this validation; DoD: added validation causes a failing test before change and passing after, `go test ./...` green.
  - [x] [S31:l90-manifest-doc-bin-prefix] Update `docs/reference/tools-manifest.md` to explicitly require relative `command` entries to use `./tools/bin/NAME`, update the JSON example to match, and note absolute paths are only for tests; DoD: doc renders on GitHub, `rg "\./tools/bin/" docs/reference/tools-manifest.md -n` finds at least one match, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S23:l90-bin-mkdir] Ensure `Makefile` creates `tools/bin` before builds by adding `mkdir -p tools/bin` (or equivalent) at the start of the `build-tools` recipe; DoD: from a clean clone `rm -rf tools/bin && make build-tools` succeeds and produces `tools/bin/{get_time,exec,fs_read_file,fs_write_file,fs_append_file,fs_rm,fs_move,fs_search,fs_mkdirp,fs_apply_patch,fs_read_lines,fs_edit_range,fs_listdir,fs_stat}`.
  - [x] [S24:l90-clean-transitional] Update `Makefile` `clean` to remove both legacy paths (`tools/<NAME>` and `tools/*/<NAME>`) and new `tools/bin/*` during the migration window (until S20 completes) to avoid stale artifacts; DoD: after `make build-tools`, `make clean` leaves `git status` clean with no leftover tool binaries.
  - [x] [S24b:l90-unblock-build-tools] Restore missing tool source directories referenced by `build-tools` (e.g., `tools/exec`, `tools/fs_write_file`) or adapt tests to current layout so `make build-tools` and `go test ./...` pass; then re-run S24 verification.
  - [x] [S25:l90-docs-diagrams-paths] Update `docs/diagrams/agentcli-seq.md` and `docs/diagrams/toolbelt-seq.md` to replace `./tools/<NAME>` with `./tools/bin/<NAME>` where tools are invoked; DoD: both diagrams render on GitHub and `rg "\./tools/(get_time|fs_|exec)" docs/diagrams -n` returns no matches.
  - [x] [S26:l90-runbook-troubleshooting-paths] Revise `docs/runbooks/troubleshooting.md` commands to build from `./tools/cmd/NAME` (post‑migration slices) and execute `./tools/bin/NAME`; DoD: copy‑pasted commands work on a clean clone after `make build build-tools`, and `rg "\./tools/(fs_|exec|get_time)" docs/runbooks -n` only shows `tools/bin` paths.
  - [x] [S27:l90-architecture-doc-alignment] Align examples in `docs/architecture/module-boundaries.md` to the canonical layout (sources under `tools/cmd/NAME/*.go`, binaries under `tools/bin/NAME`) and update any `go build -o tools/<name> ./tools/<...>` snippets; DoD: doc renders and `rg "go build -o tools/" docs/architecture -n` returns no matches.
  - [x] [S28:l90-toolsjson-path-validation] Add a focused unit test in `internal/tools/manifest_test.go` that asserts relative `command[0]` entries in `tools.json` start with `./tools/bin/` (allow absolute paths for test fixtures); DoD: test fails before S02 and passes after, with `go test ./...` green and coverage unchanged.
  - [x] [S29:l90-test-helper-buildtool] Introduce `tools/testutil/buildtool.go` providing `BuildTool(t, name string) (binPath string)` that builds from `./tools/cmd/<name>` into `t.TempDir()`; migrate one representative test (e.g., `tools/fs_listdir_test.go`) to use it as a pattern; DoD: tests pass locally (`go test ./...`), helper adopted without breaking other tests.
  - [x] [S01:l90-make-bin-outputs] Update `Makefile` `build-tools` and `clean` to emit/remove binaries under `tools/bin/NAME` while building from current sources (`tools/timecli`, `tools/exec`, `tools/fs_*`, and `tools/fs_read_file.go`), without moving sources yet; DoD: `make build-tools` creates `tools/bin/{get_time,exec,fs_read_file,fs_write_file,fs_append_file,fs_rm,fs_move,fs_search,fs_mkdirp,fs_apply_patch,fs_read_lines,fs_edit_range,fs_listdir,fs_stat}` and `make clean` removes them, `git status` clean, `go test ./...` green.
  - [x] [S02:l90-toolsjson-bin] Point `tools.json` `command` entries to `./tools/bin/NAME` for all tools (names exactly as current binaries), keeping schemas unchanged; DoD: `./bin/agentcli -prompt "time?" -tools ./tools.json -debug` works with `get_time`, integration tests unaffected, `go test ./...` green.
  - [x] [S03:l90-docs-build-path] Revise `README.md` and `docs/reference/tools-manifest.md` usage snippets to reference `tools/bin/NAME` and `make build-tools`; DoD: docs render, examples run from clean clone (`make build build-tools` then quickstart), tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S04:l90-gitignore-tighten] Narrow `.gitignore` to ignore `tools/bin/**` only (and keep sources under `tools/cmd/**` tracked), removing blanket `tools/*/*` ignores while preserving exceptions for `*.go`; DoD: creating `tools/cmd/demo/main.go` is tracked, `make build-tools` yields ignored `tools/bin/*`, `git status` clean, tests green.
  - [x] [S05:l90-test-discovery-update] Update test helpers that build tools to use canonical package paths once migrated (e.g., change build path comments and invocations from `./tools/fs_mkdirp` or `./tools/fs_read_file.go` to `./tools/cmd/NAME` as each tool moves); DoD: targeted tests updated only when their tool migrates, all tests green.
  - [x] [S05a:l90-test-update-fs_mkdirp] After [S06:l90-migrate-fs_mkdirp], replace inline builder in `tools/fs_mkdirp_test.go` with `testutil.BuildTool(t, "fs_mkdirp")` and remove direct `go build ./fs_mkdirp`; DoD: `go test ./tools -run FsMkdirp` passes on Unix/Windows, full suite green.
   - [x] [S06:l90-migrate-fs_mkdirp] Move `tools/fs_mkdirp/main.go` to `tools/cmd/fs_mkdirp/fs_mkdirp.go`, update its tests to build from `./tools/cmd/fs_mkdirp`, and adjust `Makefile` source mapping for `fs_mkdirp`; DoD: `go test ./tools -run FsMkdirp` passes, `make build-tools` builds `tools/bin/fs_mkdirp` from new path, no other tests fail.
  - [x] [S07:l90-migrate-fs_read_file] Move single-file `tools/fs_read_file.go` to `tools/cmd/fs_read_file/fs_read_file.go`, update `tools/fs_read_file_test.go` build path, and update `Makefile` mapping; DoD: `go test ./tools -run FsReadFile` passes, `tools/bin/fs_read_file` builds from new path, suite green.
  - [x] [S08:l90-migrate-exec] Move `tools/exec/main.go` to `tools/cmd/exec/exec.go`, update `tools/exec_test.go` build path, and adjust `Makefile`; DoD: `go test ./tools -run Exec` passes, `tools/bin/exec` builds from new path, suite green.
  - [x] [S09:l90-migrate-get_time] Move `tools/timecli/main.go` to `tools/cmd/get_time/get_time.go` (binary remains `get_time`), update `tools/timecli_test.go` build path, and adjust `Makefile`; DoD: `go test ./tools -run Time` passes, `tools/bin/get_time` builds from new path, suite green.
  - [x] [S10:l90-migrate-fs_write_file] Move `tools/fs_write_file/main.go` to `tools/cmd/fs_write_file/fs_write_file.go`, update its test and `Makefile`; DoD: targeted tests pass, binary builds from new path, suite green.

  - [x] [S20:l90-remove-legacy-paths] Delete legacy tool sources left under `tools/*` (e.g., `tools/fs_read_file.go`, `tools/*/main.go`) with `git rm` and update `Makefile`/`clean` to stop referencing old paths; DoD: `rg "\./tools/(fs_|exec|timecli)" -g '!tools/cmd/**'` finds no sources, `make build-tools clean` reproducible, suite green.
  - [x] [S21:l90-update-integration] Update `cmd/agentcli/tools_integration_test.go` and any examples to assume `tools/bin` layout and validate end-to-end tool invocation via `tools.json`; DoD: integration test passes with new paths, README quickstart verified, suite green.
  - [x] [S22:l90-final-sweep] Search-and-replace any remaining built-path references (`./tools/<NAME>`) across repo (code, docs, scripts) to `./tools/bin/<NAME>` and ensure links and examples resolve; DoD: workspace grep returns none, `make lint test build build-tools` all green, `git status` clean.
   - [x] [S22a:l90-final-sweep-lint] Ensure `make lint` (golangci-lint) and `make check-tools-paths` (ripgrep) run green in an environment with these tools installed; no code changes expected; mark S22 complete when both gates pass.
   - [x] [S22a-next:l90-install-deps] Blocked locally: ripgrep (rg) not installed and golangci-lint not on PATH. Next step: install `rg` and ensure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` (or `GOBIN`) is on PATH so `golangci-lint` is discoverable; then rerun `make check-tools-paths` and `make lint`.
  - [x] [S22b:l90-final-sweep-lint-docs] Add README developer prerequisites for ripgrep and golangci-lint with install snippets and PATH note to unblock local lint/path checks without code changes.
  - [x] [S32:l90-manifest-crossplat-bin-prefix] In `internal/tools/manifest.go`, perform relative `command[0]` bin-prefix validation using `filepath.ToSlash` and `path.Clean` so Windows path separators are normalized; extend `internal/tools/manifest_test.go` with cases for `./tools/bin/name` and `..\\tools\\bin\\name` (normalized reject) to ensure cross‑platform correctness; DoD: new test fails before change and passes after, `go test ./...` green on Linux/macOS and Windows runners when available.
  - [x] [S33:l90-move-fs_read_file-tests] Relocate `tools/fs_read_file_test.go` to `tools/cmd/fs_read_file/fs_read_file_test.go` and refactor it to use `tools/testutil/buildtool.go::BuildTool(t,"fs_read_file")` after [S29:l90-test-helper-buildtool]; DoD: `go test ./tools/cmd/fs_read_file -run FsReadFile` passes in isolation and `go test ./...` remains green.
  - [x] [S34:l90-integration-relative-tools-bin] Amend `cmd/agentcli/tools_integration_test.go` to build `fs_write_file` and `fs_read_file` into `tools/bin/` under a temp working directory and write a manifest using relative `./tools/bin/<name>` paths to exercise the new convention end‑to‑end; DoD: test passes locally and in CI with no reliance on absolute paths, suite green.

  - [x] [S48:l90-untrack-legacy-binaries] (after [S04:l90-gitignore-tighten]) Remove any tracked legacy binaries under `tools/*` without extensions (e.g., `tools/fs_read_file`) via `git rm --cached` and ensure `.gitignore` only ignores `tools/bin/**`; DoD: `git status` shows removals, `make build-tools` produces only `tools/bin/*`, suite green.
   - [x] [S60:l90-make-tools-var] Introduce `TOOLS := get_time exec fs_read_file fs_write_file fs_append_file fs_rm fs_move fs_search fs_mkdirp fs_apply_patch fs_read_lines fs_edit_range fs_listdir fs_stat` in `Makefile` and refactor `build-tools` and `clean` to iterate deterministically over this list (no source moves yet), preserving current legacy source paths; DoD: `make build-tools` yields `tools/bin/{get_time,exec,fs_read_file,fs_write_file,fs_append_file,fs_rm,fs_move,fs_search,fs_mkdirp,fs_apply_patch,fs_read_lines,fs_edit_range,fs_listdir,fs_stat}` and `make clean` removes them all with a single list, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S61:l90-make-build-tool-target] Add `Makefile` target `build-tool` that builds a single tool into `tools/bin/$(NAME)` from legacy sources using `make build-tool NAME=fs_read_file`; DoD: command works for at least `fs_read_file` and `fs_mkdirp`, errors clearly when `NAME` missing or unknown; tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S62:l90-verify-manifest-paths] Add `Makefile` target `verify-manifest-paths` that fails if `tools.json` has any relative `command[0]` not starting with `./tools/bin/` (allow absolute paths), implemented with `rg` and precise messaging; DoD: `make verify-manifest-paths` fails before S02 and passes after, message cites offending entries; tests unchanged and green.
   - [x] [S63:l90-docs-contrib-workflow] Update `README.md` Contributing to mention `make check-tools-paths`, `make verify-manifest-paths`, and `make build-tool NAME=<name>` as the local workflow during migration; DoD: doc renders on GitHub, commands copy‑paste, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S64:l90-migration-guide-doc] Add `docs/migrations/tools-layout.md` describing migration from `./tools/<NAME>` to `./tools/bin/<NAME>` and new source layout `tools/cmd/<NAME>`, and link it from `docs/README.md`; DoD: docs render on GitHub, links resolve, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S66:l90-clean-future-checklist-legacy] Replace legacy path references in `FUTURE_CHECKLIST.md` (e.g., `tools/timecli`, single-file `tools/*.go`) with canonical `tools/cmd/*` and `tools/bin/*` or remove obsolete bullets; verification: `rg -n 'tools/timecli|tools/[a-z_]+\.go' FUTURE_CHECKLIST.md` returns no matches; DoD: docs render, no functional code changes, `go test ./...` green.
  - [x] [S67:l90-buildtool-drop-legacy] After S33–S47 are complete, simplify `tools/testutil/buildtool.go` by removing legacy source fallbacks (`tools/<name>` dir, `tools/<name>.go` file, and the special-case `tools/timecli`), keeping only `tools/cmd/<name>`; update one representative test to continue using `BuildTool` (no behavior change); verification: `rg -n 'tools/timecli|filepath.Join\(repoRoot, "tools", name\)|tools/[a-z_]+\.go' tools/testutil/buildtool.go` finds no matches; DoD: `go test ./...` green.
  - [x] [S68:l90-ci-matrix] Add GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run `make tidy lint test build build-tools` on a Go matrix across `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, and `windows-latest` (install ripgrep where needed); verification: `rg -n 'make (tidy|lint|test|build|build-tools)' .github/workflows/ci.yml` matches and the matrix includes the three OSes; DoD: CI passes on all platforms with no new findings.
  - [x] [S69:l90-ci-verify-tools-hygiene] Extend the CI workflow to run `make check-tools-paths` and (after S62) `make verify-manifest-paths` as distinct steps; verification: `rg -n 'check-tools-paths|verify-manifest-paths' .github/workflows/ci.yml` matches both; DoD: workflow fails when a legacy path or invalid manifest command is introduced and passes on current branch.
  - [x] [S70:l90-integ-use-buildtool] Refactor `cmd/agentcli/tools_integration_test.go` to use `tools/testutil/buildtool.go::BuildTool(t,"fs_write_file")` and `BuildTool(t,"fs_read_file")` instead of invoking `go build` manually; keep manifest relative `./tools/bin/*` and temp working directory behavior; verification: `go test ./cmd/agentcli -run AdvertisesSchemas` passes and diff limited to the single test file; DoD: full `go test ./...` green.
* [x] Standardize JSON error contract for all tools — on failure, write single-line stderr `{"error":"<escaped>","hint?":"<opt>"}` and exit non-zero; runner maps to tool message; DoD: negative-path tests per tool, docs snippet, CI green.

* [x] Add a .gitattributes file to enforce LF line endings for Go, Markdown and shell scripts and to normalize text files to avoid CRLF-related failures and noisy diffs, smallest change is committing a single .gitattributes with patterns only; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, deterministic runs locally and in CI with no new findings from vet, format, lint, security scanning and secret detection, verification by creating a CRLF file then confirming Git normalizes to LF on checkout and go test ./... passes on Linux and Windows without spurious failures, rollback by reverting the .gitattributes file.
* [x] Add a make fmt target that runs gofmt -s -w over the repository and mention it briefly in README near lint so developers can apply formatting easily, smallest change is adding the target and a one line README note, scope Makefile and docs, low risk; DoD includes running make fmt with no unintended diffs, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by running the command locally, rollback by reverting the edits.

* [x] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.
* [x] Add a minimal .editorconfig (root=true) specifying utf-8, end_of_line=lf, insert_final_newline=true, indent_style=tab for Go and indent_style=space indent_size=2 for Markdown and YAML to reduce formatting drift across editors, smallest change is committing the single .editorconfig file; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security scanning and secret detection) with no new findings, verification by saving files in common editors and observing no diffs beyond gofmt expectations, rollback by reverting the file.
  - [x] [S01:l207-unblock-lint] Implement Makefile lint PATH invocation by resolving `$(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint`; `golangci-lint` now runs headlessly. Next step: resolve goanalysis error by upgrading golangci-lint to a version compatible with Go 1.24+.
  - [x] [S02:l207-upgrade-golangci] Pin/upgrade golangci-lint to a version compatible with current Go toolchain so `make lint` passes locally and in CI; then re-run `make lint` and complete L207 DoD.
   - [x] [S02a:l207-lint-green-internal] Resolve existing `errcheck` and `gocyclo` findings in internal packages first to drive `make lint` toward green without weakening gates.
* [x] Add reports and coverage artifacts to .gitignore including reports/ tests directory and coverage outputs so running the test runner does not create noisy untracked files, smallest change is appending ignore patterns only, scope repository hygiene, low risk; DoD includes running scripts/test-runner.sh and verifying git status is clean, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by git status before and after, rollback by removing the new ignore lines.
* [x] Augment the root .gitignore to include standard entries for the dist directory, macOS .DS_Store, the Go go.work workspace file, and common IDE folders .idea and .vscode to prevent accidental commits of local artifacts, smallest change is appending those patterns only to the existing file, scope repository hygiene, low risk and independent, DoD includes running git status before and after creating those files locally to confirm they are ignored, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, lint, static and security scans, secret detection) with no new findings, peer review completed, verification by reproducing the ignore behavior on a clean clone, rollback by reverting the .gitignore addition.
* [x] Make builds reproducible by adding -trimpath and stripped ldflags to Makefile build and build-tools while keeping static CGO settings and documenting the change succinctly, smallest change is editing the build recipes only and a short README sentence, scope Makefile and docs, low risk; DoD includes two clean builds producing identical checksums for binaries, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by comparing shasums of repeated builds, rollback by reverting the Makefile edits.
* [x] CLI help: make `--help`/`-h`/`help` print full usage and exit 0 before any required-flag validation or side effects; DoD: `agentcli --help` prints all flags (names, defaults, env fallbacks, precedence) and examples, exits 0 on all OSes; `go test` adds a test that asserts help output and code path; CI and all gates green; one peer review completed.
* [x] Split timeouts and make HTTP configurable independently: add `-http-timeout` (env fallback `OAI_HTTP_TIMEOUT`) used exclusively for the OpenAI POST and keep `-tool-timeout` for tools (default 30s), wire `actions/setup-go` CI to exercise both, update README and docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md, and add unit/integration tests that force a delayed fake server/tool to confirm each timeout triggers the correct error path; DoD: both flags honored, defaults sane (HTTP 60–120s), tests green, docs updated, CI gates green, peer review done.
* [x] Add resilient HTTP retries with backoff for transient failures: introduce `-http-retries` and `-http-retry-backoff` (cap, jitter) to retry on timeouts, network errors, 429, and 5xx, include `Idempotency-Key` header per request to avoid duplicate side effects, respect `Retry-After`, and log attempts to the audit file; DoD: unit tests simulate timeout then success and 429 with Retry-After, integration test with fake server passes, defaults conservative (e.g., 2 retries), docs updated, CI green, peer review done.
  - [x] [S01:retries-doc-flags] Update README "Common flags" to document `-http-retries` and `-http-retry-backoff`; tests already green.
  - [x] [S02:retries-audit-attempts] Emit per-attempt audit entries for HTTP retries including attempt number, status, and backoff; add unit test; docs/runbook note.
  - [x] [S03] Respect Retry-After header for 429/5xx with unit tests
  - [x] [S01] Introduce minimal retry policy with tests (timeouts and 5xx); no flags yet
  - [x] [S02] Wire `-http-retries` and `-http-retry-backoff` flags; add stable `Idempotency-Key` across retries with unit test
* [x] Emit precise HTTP timing and failure cause to the audit: record DNS/connect/TLS/write/read durations, status, and whether the context deadline fired vs server closed, and surface a concise user hint (“increase -http-timeout or reduce prompt/model latency”); DoD: new fields present in `.goagent/audit/*` with a passing test that asserts structure, performance unaffected, CI green, peer review done.
* [x] Runbook entry for `context deadline exceeded`: add a troubleshooting section that explains causes (slow model, proxy timeouts, too-small `-http-timeout`), mitigation steps (raise `-http-timeout`, tune proxy `proxy_read_timeout`, reduce prompt size), and an example of enabling retries; DoD: docs render on GitHub, copy-paste checks complete, CI docs gates green, peer review done.
* [x] Make relative paths in tools.json resolve against the directory containing that tools.json (not process CWD), preserving existing security checks that reject `..` escapes; update `internal/tools/manifest.go` to anchor, clean, and normalize paths cross-platform, adapt unit/integration tests to cover a manifest in a nested folder, adjust `make verify-manifest-paths` if needed, update `docs/reference/tools-manifest.md` to document the rule and absolute-path allowance for tests, and verify end-to-end that an agent run using a nested tools.json with relative `./tools/bin/*` works; DoD: unit/integration tests added and green on Linux/macOS/Windows, docs updated, CI and all quality gates green, one peer review completed.
* [x] Makefile: preserve the logs directory during the clean target by removing any deletion of logs while keeping other artifact removals; DoD: from a clean clone create a sentinel file under logs, build artifacts, run clean, verify the sentinel remains and artifacts are gone, repo status is clean, all gates (lint/vet/format/tests/security/secret) green, one peer review completed.
  - [x] [S01:clean-preserve-logs-verified] Verified `make clean` preserves `logs/` (sentinel survives) and removes artifacts (`tools/bin`, `bin`, `reports`, `.goagent`).
  - [x] [S02:clean-lint-fixes-tools] Resolve repo-wide `golangci-lint` findings (errcheck/gocyclo in `tools/cmd/*`) so quality gates are green for this item.
    - [x] [S02d:errcheck-encode-and-visits] Check json.Encode errors in `fs_listdir`, `fs_read_lines`, `fs_stat`; handle `WalkDir`/`Info`/visit errors deterministically; update tests to check Unmarshal and cleanup removes.
    - [x] [S02a:lint-errcheck-fs_read_write] Fix errcheck in `tools/cmd/fs_read_file` and `tools/cmd/fs_write_file`; tests green.
  - [x] [S02b:lint-errcheck-batch-2] Address remaining errcheck in `get_time`, `fs_append_file`, and `fs_apply_patch` (encode/close and unsafe ignores); re-run lint.
    - [x] [S02c:lint-errcheck-fs_move] Address errcheck in `tools/cmd/fs_move` and its tests (check json.Encode, close defers, test Unmarshal); tests green.
* [x] Makefile: add a guarded clean-logs target that deletes logs only when the file logs/STATE (trimmed of whitespace) equals DOWN and otherwise no-ops, add a clean-all target that runs clean then clean-logs, add a deterministic test target that exercises allowed (DOWN) and blocked (non-DOWN or missing) cases and wire it into CI, and document the behavior in README; DoD: local test target passes for all cases, CI runs it on all OSes and is green, logs are never deleted unless STATE is DOWN, all quality gates green, one peer review completed.
* [x] Diagnose and fix opaque `context deadline exceeded` on chat POST by instrumenting HTTP phase timings (DNS/connect/TLS/write/read/idle), verifying and wiring `-http-timeout`/`OAI_HTTP_TIMEOUT` is actually applied to the OpenAI POST (independent from tool timeouts) or adding it if missing, and upgrading the surfaced error to include base URL, phase, and configured timeout with actionable hints (e.g., server unreachable vs slow response); add table-driven unit tests and an integration test with a fake slow server and a refused connection to prove (a) correct timeout behavior, (b) clear error text and exit code 1 for network/timeout, 2 for CLI misuse, and (c) that raising `-http-timeout` resolves the slow-server case; update README and the troubleshooting runbook accordingly; DoD: failing tests first then passing, running the provided repro command yields a precise cause message (not a generic context deadline), CI and all quality gates green, one peer review completed.
* [x] Expand make clean to remove build/test artifacts like bin/coverage.out and reports/ to keep the working tree tidy after local runs, because currently these files remain and can cause noisy diffs; smallest change is editing the clean recipe only; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD includes running make build build-tools test to create artifacts then make clean to remove them with git status clean, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by reproducing the sequence on a clean clone, rollback by reverting the Makefile edit.
  - [x] [S00:clean-removes-artifacts] Verified current Makefile removes bin/, coverage.out, reports/, .goagent, and tools/bin; no recipe change needed for this slice.
  - [x] [S01:clean-gates] Lint gates currently fail due to pre-existing issues (errcheck/gocyclo). Next step: address lint findings to satisfy Definition of Done for this item.
  - [x] [S02:clean-errcheck-agentcli] Fix errcheck and gofmt findings under `cmd/agentcli` (unit + integration tests); reduce `runAgent` cyclomatic complexity below threshold by extracting helpers; DoD: tests green; lint passes for `cmd/agentcli/**` locally; full repo lint may still have findings to be addressed in follow-up slices; no gate weakening.
* [x] Bound tools/fs_search scanning by skipping known binary/output directories (e.g., .git, bin, logs, tools/* built binaries) and enforcing a sane per-file size limit with clear errors to prevent performance and memory spikes on large repositories; smallest change is editing tools/fs_search/main.go only; scope tools; moderate risk due to traversal changes; DoD includes unit tests covering directory exclusion, size limits, and unchanged matching semantics on text files, tests green locally and in CI with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security/secret detection) with no new findings, docs/runbooks updated with the exclusions, peer review completed, verification by searching a repo containing large/binary files and observing fast, bounded behavior, rollback by reverting the changes.
  - [x] [S01:fs_search-skip-binaries] Skip `bin/`, `logs/`, and `tools/bin/` during walking; add test
  - [x] [S02:fs_search-size-limit] Enforce 1MiB per-file size cap with clear error; add unit test
* [x] Centralize audit logs under repository root .goagent/audit/YYYYMMDD.log by resolving module root (walk up to go.mod) in internal/tools/runner.go instead of using current working directory so subpackage tests no longer create nested .goagent directories; smallest change: edit appendAuditLog to compute root and write there; scope internal/tools only; low risk; DoD: failing test first then passing implementation, go test -race -cover ./... green with quality gates and docs unchanged, verify only root path receives logs and they are ignored by Git, rollback by reverting the change.
* [x] Enforce flag > env > default precedence for `-http-timeout`, `-tool-timeout`, and `-timeout` and add table-driven tests that set env to 90s and flags to 300s verifying the effective values are 5m; DoD: tests green, CI gates green, peer review done.
* [x] Remove any `min()` clamping between global `-timeout` and `-http-timeout`; use `-http-timeout` exclusively for the chat POST context and `-timeout` only for overall run budget; DoD: unit/integration test proves a 300s HTTP timeout is honored even when global is shorter/longer, CI green, peer review done.
* [x] Make duration flags robust: accept plain seconds (int) as well as Go duration strings by parsing `300` as `300s`; DoD: tests cover `300`, `300s`, `5m`, invalid inputs; CI green, peer review done.
* [x] Print the **effective** timeouts and their **sources** (flag/env/default) under `-debug` and in timeout errors (e.g., `http-timeout=5m source=flag`); DoD: unit test asserts formatting, failing timeout shows accurate values, CI green, peer review done.
* [x] Add `--print-config` that exits 0 and dumps the resolved config (model, base URL, all timeouts with sources) so misconfigurations are obvious; DoD: unit test for output, docs updated, CI green, peer review done.
* [x] Integration test: fake slow server proves `-http-timeout 300` allows \~5m before cancel while default (90s) cancels \~1m30s; DoD: deterministic test with `httptest.Server` and sleep, CI green, peer review done.
* [x] Create ADR-0003 “Toolchain & Lint Policy (Go + golangci-lint)” documenting that CI must use the Go version declared by `go.mod` and that `golangci-lint` is pinned to a known-good version for that Go line; include upgrade policy (bump both together via PR), risks, and rollback. Smallest change: add `docs/adr/0003-toolchain-and-lint-policy.md` with context, options, decision, consequences, and a link to the canonical issue URL (created in this PR). DoD: ADR rendered on GitHub, linked from `docs/README.md` and `README.md` (Tooling section); all gates green; one peer review completed.
  - [x] [S01:l248-lint-green] Install ripgrep (rg) locally so `make check-tools-paths` can run, then rerun `make lint` to satisfy gates; next step: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ripgrep` (Linux) or `brew install ripgrep` (macOS).
* [x] Pin CI to module Go version using `actions/setup-go` with `go-version-file: go.mod`. Smallest change: edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to configure `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version-file: go.mod` in every job (linux/macos/windows), print `go version` for traceability, and keep the existing matrix. DoD: a fresh CI run shows the same Go major.minor on all OSes (visible in logs), `make tidy lint test build build-tools` pass, gates green, peer review completed, rollback by reverting the workflow hunk.
* [x] Change the **default sampling temperature to 1.0** by updating the agent CLI’s flag default and the underlying request-option defaults, ensure the value propagates into the outbound payload when supported, add a unit test that asserts the resolved default is 1.0 when no overrides are provided, and update README’s “Common flags” so `-temp` shows “default 1.0” instead of 0.2 (also add a short rationale line in docs); DoD: unit tests green, `agentcli -h` displays 1.0, README/Docs updated. ([GitHub][1])
* [x] Implement a **model capability map** in the internal request-options layer to determine `SupportsTemperature` per model (e.g., GPT-5 variants → true; any known exceptions → false with inline comment), expose a simple lookup used at call time, and write a table-driven unit test that covers at least three model IDs and both outcomes; DoD: lookup used by payload builder, tests green, brief note added to docs “Model parameter compatibility”.
* [x] Update the **payload encoder** so that `temperature` is omitted entirely when `SupportsTemperature == false` and included (1.0 or user override) when true, preserving existing behavior for other params; add golden-file or snapshot tests for both branches; DoD: encoder tests green and logs confirm presence/omission in debug mode.
* [x] Add an **ADR (“Default LLM Call Policy”)** under `docs/` (create `docs/adr` if missing) capturing context, options considered, the decision to default temperature to 1.0 with capability-based omission, and the retry/guard policies; include a Mermaid sequence of the tool-call flow; DoD: ADR merged and diagram renders on GitHub.
* [x] Provide a **worked example** in `examples/` demonstrating a tool-call session that exercises: default temperature 1.0, parallel tool calls, and the corrected message sequencing; include a tiny fake tool and a transcript dump; DoD: `go test ./examples/...` (or your repo’s test convention) passes and README links to it.
* [x] Add **parallel tool-call support**: execute multiple `tool_calls[]` concurrently and append exactly one `tool` message per returned `tool_call_id` in any order acceptable to the API, then continue; include a concurrency unit test that simulates two tools with different latencies; DoD: tests green and docs example added.
* [x] Fix **message assembly** so the flow is always: user/assistant→assistant with `tool_calls[]`→one `tool` message per `tool_call_id` with the tool output→assistant (repeat as needed), never emitting a standalone `tool` message early; add an end-to-end mock test that exercises one and multiple tool calls; DoD: test green and README shows a minimal JSON example of correct sequencing. ([OpenAI Platform][2])
* [ ] Document correct tool-call sequencing with a minimal JSON example in `README.md#tool-calls` (assistant with `tool_calls[]` → tool messages with matching `tool_call_id` → assistant), including note on parallel tool calls requiring one tool message per id. ([Microsoft Learn][8])
* [ ] Implement a **message-sequence validator** that rejects any `role:"tool"` message unless it responds to a prior assistant message with `tool_calls[]` and a matching `tool_call_id`, and surface a pre-flight error that mirrors the API’s wording; add unit tests for valid/invalid transcripts; DoD: validator on by default, tests green, troubleshooting doc updated. ([OpenAI Platform][2])
* [ ] Add a **regression test for the exact 400** you hit by crafting a transcript with a stray `role:"tool"` lacking a prior `tool_calls[]`; assert the validator blocks it locally with a helpful error and that the request is never sent; DoD: failing test first, then fix, then green, and an entry added to the Troubleshooting section.
* [ ] CLI errors: when required flags (e.g., `-prompt`) are missing, print concise error followed by the usage synopsis and exit with code 2 (not 1); DoD: unit test verifies stderr contains error + usage, exit code is 2, no network or tool exec attempted; CI and all gates green; one peer review completed.
* [ ] CLI version: add `--version`/`-version` to print semver + commit + build date and exit 0 without validating other flags; DoD: unit test asserts format and exit code; README “Usage” updated; CI and all gates green; one peer review completed.
* [x] Add `make check-go-version` that fails early if the active toolchain doesn’t match `go.mod`. Smallest change: in `Makefile`, add target that extracts `MOD_GO=$$(awk '/^go [0-9]+\\.[0-9]+/ {print $$2; exit}' go.mod)` and `SYS_GO=$$(go version | sed -E 's/.*go([0-9]+\\.[0-9]+).*/\\1/')`; compare and `exit 2` with a clear message if different. Document this target briefly in `README.md` under “Developer workflow”. DoD: running `make check-go-version` passes when versions match and fails with an actionable message when mismatched; CI invokes it (temporarily from a one-off verification commit) and stays green; peer review completed.
  - [x] [S01:l252-wire-lint] Prepend `check-go-version` to `lint` so it runs first; local `make lint` now fails fast on toolchain mismatch as intended.
  - [x] [S01b:l252-local-proof] Verified locally that `make lint` executes `check-go-version` first (observed "check-go-version: OK" before golangci-lint output); CI verification remains pending.
  - [x] [S02b:l252-robust-mod-parse] Harden `Makefile` `check-go-version` to parse Go major.minor via `go mod edit -json` for stability; `make lint` and `go test ./...` green locally.
  - [x] [S02e:l252-local-test-order] Add a deterministic unit test `internal/ci/ci_workflow_test.go::TestLintOrderLocallyAndInWorkflow` that inspects the Makefile lint recipe block to ensure `check-go-version` precedes `golangci-lint`, and asserts the CI workflow contains the explicit lint order assertion step. Suite green.
  - [x] [S02d:l252-blocked-note] Blocked locally: cannot push or open PR from this session to trigger CI. Next step: open a PR (or push to a tracked branch) to run the workflow and verify logs show `check-go-version: OK` before golangci-lint across the OS matrix.
  - [x] [S04:l252-ci-lint-step-name] Name the workflow step explicitly as `lint (includes check-go-version)` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so reviewers can spot the gate in logs quickly; DoD: CI run shows the named step and includes the `check-go-version: OK` line preceding linter output.
  - [x] [S05:l252-doc-ci-gate] Update `docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md` to state that `make lint` enforces `check-go-version` first and that CI runs the same gate; include a short excerpt of the expected log line `check-go-version: OK (system X.Y matches go.mod X.Y)`; DoD: docs render on GitHub, links intact, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S06:l252-readme-badge] Add a README CI badge pointing to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and label it "CI (lint+test+build)"; DoD: badge renders and links to the workflow page, no broken images, tests unchanged and green.
  - [x] [S07:l252-ci-assert-order] Amend `.github/workflows/ci.yml` lint step to pipe output to `lint.log` and add a subsequent `bash` step that fails if `rg -n "^check-go-version: OK" lint.log` is absent or occurs after `rg -n "^golangci-lint version" lint.log`; DoD: CI logs show both lines in order and job stays green.
  - [x] [S08:l252-ci-upload-artifact] Add an `actions/upload-artifact@v4` step to publish `lint.log` as `lint-${{ matrix.os }}`; DoD: artifacts visible for ubuntu/macos/windows in the run.
  - [x] [S09:l252-readme-dev-hint] Update `README.md` Developer workflow to include the exact mismatch message `Go toolchain mismatch: system X.Y != go.mod X.Y` and remediation; DoD: `rg -n "Go toolchain mismatch" README.md` matches once, docs render.
  - [x] [S01:l242-exe-suffix] Resolve Windows suffix by referencing "golangci-lint$(EXE)" under GOPATH/bin in lint recipe so invocation works cross‑platform after on-demand install.
  - [x] [S01:l242-preexisting-lints] Resolve current golangci-lint and fmtcheck findings in tests to get `make lint` green; scope: fix errcheck on cleanup removes and gofmt -s formatting; no gate weakening.
  - [x] [S02b:l207-install-rg] Blocked locally: ripgrep (rg) not installed; `make check-tools-paths` fails in lint. Next step: install ripgrep and rerun `make lint`.
* [x] Ensure `check-go-version` is enforced in CI and locally by wiring it into `make lint`. Smallest change: prepend `$(MAKE) check-go-version` in the `lint` recipe before any linter runs. DoD: `make lint` fails fast on version drift (manual test by temporarily exporting an older/newer Go on a dev machine), passes otherwise; CI shows the check executed before golangci-lint; all gates green; peer review completed.
  - [ ] [S02:l252-ci-green] Verify in CI that the Lint job executes `check-go-version` first and passes on runners matching `go.mod`; next step: run CI and confirm logs.
Blocked: cannot push to origin due to missing GitHub credentials; next step is to configure GitHub authentication (e.g. add SSH key or run gh auth login with write access), then push a branch and open a PR to trigger CI and capture the run URL for verification.
  - [ ] [S02c:l252-open-pr] Open a PR for this branch to trigger CI on all OSes; after the run, capture the workflow URL and verify `check-go-version: OK` appears before `golangci-lint` output in the lint step across the matrix; then proceed to mark S02 done.
  - [ ] [S02a:l252-run-ci] Trigger CI by pushing this branch or opening a PR to run the workflow; confirm logs show `check-go-version` output before `golangci-lint` and that the step passes on runners matching `go.mod`; record the CI run URL in the PR/issue, then mark S02 complete.
  - [ ] [S03:l252-create-ci-workflow] Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a single `lint-test-build` job (matrix: `ubuntu-latest`, `macos-latest`, `windows-latest`) that uses `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version-file: go.mod`, then runs `make tidy lint test build build-tools`; DoD: a CI run is triggered on push/PR, logs show `check-go-version: OK` in the `make lint` step before golangci-lint output on all OSes, and the job passes.
  - [ ] [S10:l252-traceability-link] When opening the CI-verification PR, include the CI run URL and note that ordering was verified; DoD: PR description updated; no code changes.
  - [ ] [S11:l252-ci-skeleton-file] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new) containing a single job `lint-test-build` with a step named exactly `lint (includes check-go-version)` that runs `make tidy && make lint | tee lint.log` and a subsequent step named exactly `Assert lint order (check-go-version before golangci-lint)` that compares line numbers of `^check-go-version: OK` and `^golangci-lint version` in `lint.log` (fail if absent or out of order); DoD: `go test ./internal/ci -run TestLintOrderLocallyAndInWorkflow` passes locally reading the workflow file and finding both expected step names.
  - [ ] [S12:l252-ci-matrix-gover] Expand the workflow to a matrix over `{ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest}` and use `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version-file: go.mod` in the `lint-test-build` job; DoD: workflow syntax validates, unit test still passes, and a PR run shows the same Go major.minor across OSes in logs.
  - [ ] [S13:l252-windows-install-rg] Add a Windows-only step before lint to install ripgrep (e.g., `choco install ripgrep -y`) so `make lint`’s `check-tools-paths`/`verify-manifest-paths` do not fail due to `ensure-rg`’s Linux/macOS-only installer; DoD: on `windows-latest`, the `lint (includes check-go-version)` step completes and finds `rg` on PATH.
  - [ ] [S14:l252-windows-shell-bash] For `windows-latest`, force GNU bash for all `run` steps that invoke `make` (set `defaults.run.shell: bash` at the job level or `shell: bash` per step) to satisfy Makefile’s bashisms and `SHELL := /bin/bash`; DoD: Windows lint step executes successfully without PowerShell/`/bin/sh` path errors, and the unit test remains green.
* [x] Pin `golangci-lint` deterministically and install to a known path. Smallest change: in `Makefile`, add `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION ?= v1.60.3` and `GOBIN ?= $(CURDIR)/bin`; an `install-golangci` target runs `curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(GOBIN) $(GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION)`; update `lint` to call `$(GOBIN)/golangci-lint run` (no PATH assumptions). Add a short note to `README.md` and `docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md` explaining the pin and location. DoD: on a clean machine `make lint` installs the pinned version into `./bin` and runs successfully; CI is green on all OSes; peer review completed; rollback by reverting `Makefile` and doc changes.
* [ ] Add `make lint-precheck` to fail fast on analyzer/export-data mismatches. Smallest change: implement a shell precheck used by `lint` that (1) validates `$(GOBIN)/golangci-lint` exists, (2) extracts `GCL=$$($(GOBIN)/golangci-lint version | sed -nE 's/.*version ([v0-9\\.]+).*/\\1/p')`, (3) compares against `MIN=v1.60.0` using `sort -V`, and (4) prints an explicit hint if too old: “golangci-lint $GCL < $MIN with Go \$\$(go version)… update GOLANGCI\_LINT\_VERSION”. DoD: with a forced older version, `make lint` fails before analysis with the hint; with the pinned version, it proceeds; CI green; peer review completed.
* [ ] Make CI use **only** the Makefile-pinned linter (no separate action). Smallest change: ensure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` removes any `golangci-lint-action` steps and runs `make lint` instead; cache `~/go/pkg/mod` as today; no additional caches required. DoD: CI green across OSes, logs show our pinned version and `lint-precheck` execution, peer review completed; rollback by restoring the action step.
* [ ] Document and operationalize the specific failure mode you hit: “golangci-lint: unsupported export data (internal/goarch version: 2)”. Smallest change: add a subsection to `docs/runbooks/troubleshooting.md` and `docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md` titled exactly that with symptoms, cause (Go/golangci-lint mismatch), and the resolution steps: run `make check-go-version`, ensure ADR-0003 policy, run `make install-golangci`, rerun `make lint`. DoD: docs render on GitHub, steps verified, CI green, peer review completed.
* [ ] (Contingency, removable later) Add a temporary CI lint job that runs with Go 1.23.x if the pinned linter still fails on 1.24.x; tests and build jobs stay on `go-version-file: go.mod`. Smallest change: duplicate the `lint` job as `lint-compat`, set `actions/setup-go@v5` `go-version: "1.23.x"`, run `make lint`, mark with a TODO comment referencing the issue to remove once ADR-0003 policy is fully green with 1.24.x. DoD: CI green with both lint jobs; issue description captures the intent to delete this path; peer review completed; rollback by deleting the `lint-compat` job.
* [ ] Add a one-shot verifier in CI that prints versions for traceability. Smallest change: in the `lint` job, after setup and install, run `go version && $(GOBIN)/golangci-lint version` and emit them as step outputs (name the step “toolchain-versions”); no functional changes. DoD: CI logs show versions on all OSes; no gate regressions; peer review completed.
* [ ] CLI flags order independence: make argument parsing accept flags in any order without requiring `-prompt` to appear first while preserving precedence (flag > env > default) and error semantics; add table-driven unit tests that permute common orders (e.g., `-prompt` before/after other flags, mixed with `-debug`, `-tools`, `--help`) asserting identical parsed values, `--help` exits 0 regardless of position, and “-prompt is required” uses exit code 2 only when truly absent; update README to state flags are order-insensitive; DoD: tests green on all OSes, CI and all quality gates green, one peer review completed.
* [ ] Fix Makefile lint target to call golangci-lint reliably after on-demand install by referencing the binary at the Go GOPATH bin directory (go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint or by exporting GOBIN=./bin and adding it to PATH within the recipe, because make lint currently prints Installing golangci-lint then fails with command not found; smallest change: edit the Makefile lint recipe only; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD: make lint succeeds on a clean machine and in CI with all gates green and no coverage regression; verify by removing the binary from PATH and running make lint; rollback by reverting the Makefile change.
  - [ ] [S02:l242-verify-green] Verify `make lint` green on a machine with ripgrep installed and in CI; if issues persist, pivot to installing into `./bin` and invoking `$(CURDIR)/bin/golangci-lint$(EXE)`.
  - [ ] [S02b:l242-install-rg] Install ripgrep (rg) locally and in CI where needed, rerun `make lint`, and capture PASS results; do not weaken gates.
* [ ] Reference docs: add `docs/reference/cli.md` that enumerates every flag with default, env fallback, precedence, and exit codes for `--help`/`--version`/missing-required; link from README; DoD: doc renders on GitHub, content matches current binary (checked by a small test that scans `--help` output for each documented flag), CI and all gates green; one peer review completed.
* [ ] Update docs `docs/llm-policy.md` to state default `temperature=1.0`, show GPT-5 `verbosity` (`low|medium|high`) and `reasoning_effort` usage, and call out that some reasoning models restrict sampling knobs; validate links in CI. ([OpenAI][6], [OpenAI Cookbook][7], [Microsoft Learn][3])
* [ ] Implement config precedence for temperature in `cmd/cli/flags.go`: `--temperature` > `LLM_TEMPERATURE` > config file > default 1.0, and if `--top-p` also provided then unset temperature with a CLI warning; add flag parsing tests in `cmd/cli/flags_test.go`. ([Anthropic][5])
* [ ] Add **parameter-recovery retry**: if the API returns HTTP 400 with a message indicating an invalid/unsupported `temperature`, strip the parameter and retry once before the normal exponential backoff path, with a structured log field describing the recovery; DoD: integration test with a mock server that first 400s on `temperature` and then succeeds without it, logs verified.
* [ ] Extend **temperature-nudge logic** to no-op when `SupportsTemperature == false` and to clamp within \[0.1, 1.0] otherwise; include unit tests that simulate repetition/format-failure signals to trigger −0.1 adjustments and diversity signals to +0.1 (never exceeding 1.0); DoD: tests green and brief docs note.
* [ ] Append ADR addendum in `docs/adr/001-default-llm-policy.md` noting the change to temperature=1.0 by default for API parity and GPT-5 compatibility, with links to OpenAI docs; include concise rationale and rollout note. ([OpenAI Platform][1], [OpenAI][6])
* [ ] Enforce **“change one sampling knob”**: when user passes `--top-p`, ensure the payload does not include `temperature`; when `--top-p` is unset, send `temperature` (default 1.0) and leave `top_p` null; add unit tests for precedence and serialization, and add a one-sentence rule to docs; DoD: tests green, docs updated.
* [ ] Implement a **prompt profile mapper** (deterministic | general | creative | reasoning) that sets temperature as follows: deterministic→0.1 (only if supported), general→1.0, creative→1.0, reasoning→1.0 unless model forbids it (then omit); add unit tests for profile→option mapping and a doc table with examples; DoD: mapper covered by tests, docs updated.
* [ ] Add **observability fields** `temperature_effective` (the value actually used after clamps/omissions) and `temperature_in_payload` (bool) to structured logs, and document them in the troubleshooting section; DoD: unit test asserts both fields are emitted, docs updated.
* [ ] Add **length backoff**: when the API reply indicates truncation (e.g., `finish_reason == "length"` or provider-equivalent), automatically double the completion cap once (bounded by remaining context) and retry; include unit tests that simulate truncation; DoD: tests green and behavior documented.
* [ ] Keep agent loop safety by verifying **`-max-steps` defaults to 8** (hard wall 15 in code if not already present), and add a unit test that the loop terminates with a clear “needs human review” message when the cap is hit; DoD: tests green and README mentions the guard. ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Ensure **HTTP timeouts and retries** align with your README flags (`-http-timeout`, `-http-retries`, `-http-retry-backoff`) by wiring jittered exponential backoff for 429/5xx/timeouts and keeping the global default timeout sane (e.g., minutes, not seconds); add unit tests for retry schedule and a doc snippet clarifying defaults; DoD: tests green and README consistent. ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Update **README “Common flags”** so all listed defaults (especially `-temp 1.0` and `-max-steps 8`) match the executable’s behavior, and add a short “Why you usually don’t need to change knobs” section pointing to the policy; DoD: README committed and links from the table of contents work. ([GitHub][1])
* [ ] Add GPT-5 smoke test `test/integration/providers/gpt5_defaults_test.sh` to run CLI with `--model gpt-5` and no flags, assert payload includes `temperature: 1` and accepts `verbosity`/`reasoning_effort`; document zero-config example in `docs/cli-usage.md`. We have GPT-5 available at GPT5_OPENAI_API_URL and GPT5_OPENAI_API_KEY environment parameters.
* [ ] Add a **smoke test path for GPT-5** in integration tests using a mock OpenAI-compatible endpoint: assert the request includes `temperature: 1` by default and that additional reasoning controls (e.g., verbosity/effort if you support them) can be set while keeping temperature at 1; DoD: test green and instructions in docs “Zero-config with GPT-5”.  We have GPT-5 available at GPT5_OPENAI_API_URL and GPT5_OPENAI_API_KEY environment parameters.
