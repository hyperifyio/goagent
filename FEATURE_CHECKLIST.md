* [x] Fix errcheck warnings by handling or asserting error returns in tests currently flagged by golangci-lint (e.g., internal/oai/client_test.go writes and cmd/agentcli/main_test.go json Encode/Setenv/Unsetenv), smallest change is editing only those tests to check errors or add narrowly justified nolint comments, scope lint hygiene (tests only), low risk, DoD includes `make lint` passing with errcheck clean and tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by running `make lint` and observing no errcheck diagnostics in those files, rollback by reverting the test edits.
* [x] Remove the inadvertently committed root-level `agentcli` binary and prevent reintroduction by adding `agentcli` (and Windows `agentcli.exe`) to `.gitignore`; smallest change is `git rm agentcli` and appending two ignore entries; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes `git ls-files --error-unmatch agentcli` failing, `make build` producing `bin/agentcli` as documented, `git status` clean after builds across OSes, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verification by running those commands; rollback by reverting the `.gitignore` edit and restoring the file if necessary.
* [x] Remove tracked lint artifacts `lint.err` and `lint_verify.err` and add ignore entries for them in `.gitignore` to keep the working tree clean after lint runs; smallest change is `git rm` those files and append two ignore lines; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes `git status` clean after `make lint`, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verification by running `make lint` and observing no new tracked `*.err` files; rollback by reverting the `.gitignore` edit and re-adding the files if required.
* [x] Fix errcheck warnings in production code by handling or asserting error returns currently flagged in non-test packages (e.g., cmd/agentcli/main.go writePrepCache calls, internal/oai/client.go resp.Body.Close/io.ReadAll, tools/cmd/img_create/*.go Encode/Close/Remove); smallest change is adding error checks or narrowly justified ignores where safe; scope limited to non-test packages and tool binaries; low risk and independent; DoD includes make lint passing with no errcheck diagnostics in these files, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green; verify by running make lint and confirming errcheck clean; rollback by reverting the edits.
* [ ] Reduce cyclomatic complexity of tools/cmd/img_create/img_create.go function run (gocyclo=54) by extracting small helpers for input parse/validate, API request/response handling, file writes, and stdout JSON; no behavior change; scope single tool; low–moderate effort; DoD includes golangci-lint gocyclo no longer flagging run (>20), make lint and tests passing, coverage unchanged, peer review completed; verify via golangci-lint output and go test; rollback by reverting the refactor.
* [ ] Reduce cyclomatic complexity of internal/tools/runner.RunToolWithJSON (gocyclo=21) by extracting environment construction and process execution into focused helpers without changing semantics; scope internal/tools only; low effort and independent; DoD includes golangci-lint gocyclo clean for this function, make lint and tests passing, coverage unchanged; verify via golangci-lint and go test; rollback by reverting the refactor.
* [ ] Remove the staticcheck SA9003 empty branch in cmd/agentcli/main.go around the pre-stage block (~line 673) by deleting the no-op branch or consolidating logic; scope single file; low risk and independent; DoD includes make lint passing with no SA9003 warning, tests green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green; verify by rerunning make lint and confirming staticcheck clean; rollback by reverting the line-level change.
* [ ] Ignore editor swap files and remove the stray .FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md.swp: append a *.swp entry to .gitignore (minimal change) and delete the existing file; scope repository hygiene; low risk and independent; DoD includes git status clean after editing with Vim (no new tracked *.swp), git ls-files --error-unmatch .FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md.swp fails, tests and lint unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green; verify by creating and saving a file in Vim and observing no tracked swap file; rollback by reverting the .gitignore edit and restoring the file if necessary.
* [ ] Correct the README fs_search example to match the tool schema: replace invalid keys (path, pattern, glob, caseInsensitive) with query (string), globs (array of file globs), and regex (boolean), and remove path since fs_search scans the repository root; smallest change is editing README only; scope documentation; low risk and independent; DoD includes the updated example running successfully on a clean clone (producing expected matches), tests and lint unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green; verify by running the example exactly as shown; rollback by reverting the README edit.
