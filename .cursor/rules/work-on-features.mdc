description: "Implement tasks from FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md with TDD and strong, diverse testing; continuously optimize iteration efficiency using logs/coding.log without weakening any quality gates"
alwaysApply: false
---

This rule directs the assistant to treat FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md as the single 
source of truth for day-to-day work and to iterate until every checklist entry 
is complete. Unchecked checkbox lines define actionable tasks and are processed 
in priority order when an entry contains an explicit priority indicator such as 
a leading bracketed number; otherwise the file is worked from top to bottom. 
The assistant may use an OpenAI-compatible API available at 
http://localhost:1234 with the model openai/gpt-oss-20b, has full shell access 
including git, and must verify behavior against real commands and services 
rather than relying on assumptions.

Continuity and efficiency improvements: Before any action, consult the recent
tail of `./logs/coding.log` to resume precisely where the last iteration ended
and avoid redundant exploratory steps. Use these deterministic markers:
- Most recent `DATE:` anchors the iteration start.
- Phase banners: `--- COMMITTING UNCHANGED TO GIT ---`, `--- WORKING ON ---`.
- Phase outcomes: `--- SUCCESSFUL END ---` and `--- ERROR:<code> ---`.
Rules for resuming:
- If the last visible phase ended with `--- SUCCESSFUL END ---` and there are no
  new diffs (`git diff --quiet` and `git diff --cached --quiet`), skip repeating
  that phase.
- If the last visible phase ended with an error or timeout, narrow scope (see
  Timeboxing and recovery) and retry only the smallest subtask necessary to make
  forward progress. Capture minimal diagnostics, then continue.

Each change follows strict test-driven development. For every behavior a 
failing test is written first or in tight lockstep, then the smallest 
implementation that makes the test pass is added, and finally the code is 
refactored while keeping the suite green. Every production change is covered by 
automated tests. At minimum there are unit tests for pure logic and integration 
tests for boundaries such as databases, filesystems, networks, queues, or 
external services, and critical user flows have end-to-end tests. Any 
regression that can be reproduced from a bug report gains a protecting test 
that fails before the fix and passes after it. Coverage never decreases and all 
changed lines and branches are exercised, yet coverage is treated only as a 
safety net rather than a sole gate.

Test effectiveness is maximized with diverse, assertion-rich techniques. For 
each public function the assistant first writes a brief plain-language 
description of properties and invariants, then implements property-based tests 
that cover equivalence classes, boundaries, and randomized cases with shrinking 
to minimal counterexamples. When exact outputs are hard to enumerate, robust 
oracles are encoded through metamorphic relations with at least two independent 
relations for oracle-hard functions, and assertions check observable behavior 
for all relevant branches. Where a reference or alternate implementation 
exists, differential tests compare independent behaviors and any discrepancy 
becomes a reproducible regression test. Mutation testing guides adequacy by 
studying surviving mutants and augmenting tests until a project-appropriate 
threshold is reached, documenting reasoning for any intentionally surviving 
mutants; if tooling is unavailable, targeted reversible perturbations are used 
to ensure tests fail when behavior is subtly altered and then the original code 
is restored. Fuzz testing is added for string, byte, file, or protocol inputs 
using Go’s built-in fuzzing with a seeded corpus, reproducible seeds, and 
promotion of any discovered failures to human-readable regression tests that 
persist in the suite.

Traceability is mandatory. Each commit and any related test or documentation 
explains intent in plain language and links to the canonical GitHub issue using 
the full URL. Short comments in tests and implementation state what is being 
verified and why it matters relative to the issue. If a behavior is not 
expressed as an executable test, it is not considered implemented. Manual 
verification steps that are necessary for UI or operations are recorded 
alongside the linked issue with exact inputs, expected outputs, and results so 
another maintainer can reproduce them.

Quality gates must all pass before a task can be considered done. The build is 
reproducible, the entire test suite is green, static analysis, type checks, 
formatters, linters, and security scanners show no new findings, and secret 
detection reveals no leaks. Performance and resource budgets are respected, and 
long-running or concurrent code is proven safe under load with targeted tests 
or benchmarks when risk exists. Backward compatibility for public interfaces is 
preserved unless the linked issue explicitly allows a breaking change and 
provides a migration path. Data migrations include idempotent forward scripts, 
tested rollback plans, and verification steps, and deployments remain safe to 
roll forward or back. Feature flags default to the safest state and include a 
removal plan. Documentation is updated in the same change set, including 
user-facing docs for visible features, developer docs for architecture or 
public APIs, operational runbooks for configuration or SRE changes, and 
changelog notes when release information would otherwise be ambiguous. At least 
one peer review is completed and recorded, and all comments are resolved or 
explicitly deferred with rationale and a linked follow-up issue.

The workflow for each checklist entry is incremental and isolated.

Deterministic task selection and ordering:
- Primary: An explicit priority indicator on a line (e.g., `[P1]`, `[1]`,
  `prio:high`) sorts before others; lower numbers mean higher priority.
- Secondary: Otherwise process top-to-bottom as the file appears in Git HEAD.
- Ties: Prefer the earliest unchecked item by line number; do not randomize.

Execution for the selected task:
- Write or update tests to verify intended behavior; implement only the minimal
  code to satisfy tests.
- Keep commits small and isolated to the current checklist line. If unrelated
  changes are staged, restage explicitly:
  1) Reset index (`git restore --staged .`) and re-add only relevant paths.
  2) Verify with `git diff --name-only --cached` that only intended files are
     staged.
- Only local commits are performed; do not push. Commit messages explain the
  “why” and link the canonical GitHub issue URL for traceability.
- After tests pass and behavior is verified, update `FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` in
  the same change set to check the exact line, keeping the diff minimal.

The loop continues until the checklist is fully complete. After finishing one
entry, immediately proceed to the next unchecked entry without re-scanning the
entire repository state; use the in-memory view of `FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` and
confirm it against HEAD only when committing.

Completion criteria:
- An entry is complete only when it is checked in `FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md` and all
  requirements in this rule are satisfied. If any requirement fails, continue on
  the same entry until it passes, then move on. Merge conflicts in the checklist
  are resolved conservatively by preserving existing check states and applying
  the smallest necessary edit to the intended task line, followed by
  revalidation that the checked status matches the implemented behavior.

Timeboxing and recovery:
- Default timeboxes (hard caps including retries):
  - Unit test cycle (single package): 2 minutes
  - Full `go test ./...`: 6 minutes
  - Single binary build: 3 minutes
  - Lint/format/static checks: 3 minutes
  - External network or API call in tests: avoid; if required, 1 minute
- When a command reaches 80% of its timebox without clear progress:
  1) Narrow scope (e.g., run targeted package tests instead of all packages),
  2) Switch to a safer subtask on the same checklist item (e.g., write the next
     smallest test), or
  3) Capture minimal diagnostics (command, exit code, last ~50 lines of output),
     then proceed.
- On timeout or flake, record the smallest reproducible repro in tests and
  proceed with the narrowed plan. Never relax gates; instead, reduce scope.

Concise operational output:
- Prefer brief, operational status over narrative. Emit:
  - The command executed,
  - The key result or assertion outcome,
  - Any error code or timeout reason,
  - Next action. Avoid restating repository facts already visible in code.

If FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md is missing, create a minimal checklist at the 
repository root and populate it with the tasks known from the immediate scope 
so that progress can be tracked from the outset. Favor deterministic and 
reproducible steps, keep randomness behind reproducible seeds, minimize fixture 
complexity, and trim redundant near-duplicate tests that do not increase 
behavioral diversity. Every failure from mutation, fuzzing, or end-to-end runs 
is distilled into a minimal counterexample with a clear name and explanatory 
comments so that intent and constraints remain obvious to future contributors.

Validation of this rule’s effectiveness:
- After updating this rule, validate on a representative unchecked checklist
  item end-to-end. Measure iteration duration using `logs/coding.log` markers
  (`DATE:`, banners, success/error) with the same method used for the baseline.
- Accept the revision only if completion is faster while all gates remain green.
  If not, refine wording (continuity, ordering, timeboxing, commit hygiene) and
  revalidate. Preserve all Definition of Done constraints.
