* [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI to enforce quality gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs on push/PR that set up Go 1.21+, cache modules, run `make lint`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, and `make build build-tools`; upload `bin/agentcli` as an artifact; set `permissions: contents: read` and fail the build on any non-zero step; matrix over `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` Ã— `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.
