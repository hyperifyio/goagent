* [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI to enforce quality gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs on push/PR that set up Go 1.21+, cache modules, run `make lint`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, and `make build build-tools`; upload `bin/agentcli` as an artifact; set `permissions: contents: read` and fail the build on any non-zero step; matrix over `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` Ã— `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.
* [ ] Add docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md mapping each quality gate to exact local commands and expected outputs for lint vet fmt unit and integration tests and coverage including a note on fixing golangci-lint not found by adding the Go bin directory to PATH, smallest change is one runbook file and a link from README Tests, low risk, DoD includes commands verified from a clean clone tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all gates green in CI peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/213.
* [ ] Document the release process in docs/releasing.md including tagging artifact naming checksums and verification and rollback guidance aligned with the planned release workflow, smallest change is a single page and links from README and the future release workflow, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes dry run steps validated locally without publishing tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by executing the documented commands in dry run rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/214.

## Review 2025-08-14
* [ ] Make lint resilient when golangci-lint is not on PATH by invoking $(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint as a fallback after go install and/or extending PATH within the recipe because a clean clone currently fails make lint with command not found; smallest change is editing the Makefile lint recipe only; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD includes running make lint successfully on a clean machine without preinstalled linter, go vet and fmtcheck still enforced, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green with no new findings, peer review completed, verification by reproducing success on a fresh shell, rollback by reverting the Makefile change.
* [ ] Keep Makefile clean target symmetrical with build-tools by also removing tools/fs_search (currently omitted) so stale tool binaries are not left behind; smallest change is adding tools/fs_search to the clean recipe; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD includes running make build-tools then make clean leaves no built tool binaries (git status clean), tests unchanged and green, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by the described commands, rollback by reverting the Makefile change.
* [ ] Update scripts/smoke-test.sh to remove goresearch and SearxNG checks and make it goagent-specific retaining only the OpenAI-compatible LLM health check and clarifying messages; smallest change is editing the script header and deleting the Searx section; scope scripts; low risk; DoD includes script runs locally and reports PASS/FAIL for LLM reachability without Docker or Searx, tests unchanged and green, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by executing the script on a clean clone, rollback by reverting the script change.
* [ ] Fix tools/timecli error contract to write errors to stderr and exit non-zero instead of printing error JSON to stdout so the runner maps failures to {"error":"..."} deterministically; smallest change is adjusting error paths in tools/timecli/main.go and adding focused unit tests; scope limited to timecli and tests; low risk; DoD includes failing test first then passing after change, README examples still work, tests elsewhere unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by piping invalid input and observing non-zero exit with stderr JSON, rollback by reverting the edits.
* [ ] Reconcile model identifier in README quick start with default OAI_MODEL by choosing one canonical value (currently README uses openai/gpt-oss-20b while defaults use oss-gpt-20b) and updating docs accordingly; smallest change is editing README only; scope documentation; low risk; DoD includes docs render correctly, examples runnable from a clean clone, tests unchanged and green, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by running the quick start with the documented model, rollback by reverting the edit.
* [ ] Stop tracking generated tool binaries under tools/ by adding .gitignore entries and removing existing binaries from version control with git rm --cached while keeping them in the working tree, and ensure Makefile clean target removes them; smallest change is updating .gitignore and running git rm --cached on tools/get_time tools/exec tools/fs_* tools/fs_search; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes running make build-tools then git status shows no modified or untracked binary artifacts, tests unchanged and green, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by the described commands, rollback by reverting the ignore change and re-adding binaries if necessary.
