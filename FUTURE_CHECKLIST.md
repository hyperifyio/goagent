* [ ] Switch submodule URLs in .gitmodules from SSH to HTTPS to simplify CI clones without SSH keys (public submodules .cursor/rules and scripts), smallest change is editing .gitmodules and running git submodule sync; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes actions/checkout with submodules enabled succeeding in a new CI workflow, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by observing CI clone success without extra SSH setup and local git submodule update --init works, rollback by reverting the .gitmodules change and syncing.

* [ ] Add a make sbom target that uses syft (or cyclonedx-gomod as a fallback if syft is unavailable) to produce a CycloneDX SBOM at reports/sbom.json from the current module and wire it into the release workflow to upload as an asset, because the repo currently lacks an SBOM which weakens supply-chain visibility; smallest change is adding one Makefile target and a short CI step with a docs sentence; scope Makefile and CI; low risk; DoD includes failing first when the tool is missing then passing with deterministic output on a clean clone, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, backward compatibility preserved, peer review completed, verification by running make sbom locally and seeing reports/sbom.json and by confirming the asset on a tagged release, rollback by reverting the Makefile and workflow edits.

* [ ] Add GitHub CodeQL code scanning for Go by committing .github/workflows/codeql.yml using the official CodeQL action with default queries on push and pull_request so security analysis runs automatically; evidence: no CodeQL workflow exists today; scope .github/workflows only; low risk and independent; DoD: CodeQL job runs green with zero new alerts, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, gofmt, golangci-lint, staticcheck, security and secret detection) with no new findings, peer review completed; verify by viewing the Security > Code scanning alerts page and the workflow run logs; rollback by deleting the workflow file.
* [ ] Add jq to README Installation prerequisites with OS-specific install snippets (apt, brew, choco) because README examples and runbooks pipe tool output to jq but prerequisites omit it; smallest change is editing README only; scope documentation; low risk and independent; DoD: README renders correctly on GitHub, examples run from a clean clone with jq installed, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verify by executing one README example end-to-end with jq and observing the pretty-printed JSON; rollback by reverting the README edit.

* [ ] Add GPT-5 smoke test `test/integration/providers/gpt5_defaults_test.sh` to run CLI with `--model gpt-5` and no flags, assert payload includes `temperature: 1` and accepts `verbosity`/`reasoning_effort`; document zero-config example in `docs/cli-usage.md`. ([OpenAI][6], [OpenAI Cookbook][7])
* [ ] Extend contract tests in `test/contract/openai_mock_test.go` to assert: (1) default payload includes `temperature:1`, (2) excluded when `!SupportsTemperature`, (3) auto-retry without temperature on 400; make tests deterministic with a fake clock. ([OpenAI Platform][1])
