* [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI to enforce quality gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs on push/PR that set up Go 1.21+, cache modules, run `make lint`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, and `make build build-tools`; upload `bin/agentcli` as an artifact; set `permissions: contents: read` and fail the build on any non-zero step; matrix over `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` × `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.
* [ ] Add docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md mapping each quality gate to exact local commands and expected outputs for lint vet fmt unit and integration tests and coverage including a note on fixing golangci-lint not found by adding the Go bin directory to PATH, smallest change is one runbook file and a link from README Tests, low risk, DoD includes commands verified from a clean clone tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all gates green in CI peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/213.

* [ ] Make lint resilient when golangci-lint is not on PATH by invoking $(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint as a fallback after go install and/or extending PATH within the recipe because a clean clone currently fails make lint with command not found; smallest change is editing the Makefile lint recipe only; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD includes running make lint successfully on a clean machine without preinstalled linter, go vet and fmtcheck still enforced, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green with no new findings, peer review completed, verification by reproducing success on a fresh shell, rollback by reverting the Makefile change.

## Review 2025-08-14
* [ ] Rename the tools exec directory to match tests and build scripts by changing the current tools/execcli directory to tools/exec and updating the Makefile build-tools rule accordingly, because go test ./... and make build-tools both fail with “directory not found” for tools/exec; smallest change is a directory rename and Makefile edit only; scope tools and Makefile; low risk; DoD includes a focused failing test first where feasible then passing after the change, no coverage regression, deterministic tests green locally and in CI, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, make build-tools succeeds from a clean clone, README exec example works end to end, peer review completed, verification by reproducing the previous failures and observing success, rollback by reverting the rename and Makefile edit.
* [ ] Restore missing tool program directories for fs_append_file, fs_write_file, fs_move and fs_rm under the tools folder to align with existing tests and README examples (current failures show go test build steps erroring with “directory not found” for these paths), choosing restoration to the expected paths used by tests rather than changing tests for minimal impact; scope tools only; moderate risk due to multiple binaries; DoD includes test-driven changes with failing tests first then passing, no coverage regression, deterministic tests green locally and in CI, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, make build-tools and go test ./... succeed from a clean clone, README examples for these tools execute successfully, peer review completed, verification by running the specific tool tests and examples, rollback by reverting the added directories.

* [ ] Add a make vuln target that installs and runs govulncheck ./... and wire it into CI after unit tests to fail builds on known vulnerabilities, smallest change is adding the target in the Makefile and a CI step once workflows exist; scope security scanning; low risk; DoD includes make vuln passing locally on a clean tree, CI green with the new step and no new findings, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all gates green, peer review completed, verification by introducing a known vulnerable transient dependency in a branch to see CI fail then removing it restores green, rollback by reverting the Makefile and CI edits.
* [ ] Add secret detection with gitleaks via a make secrets target and a CI step using the official action with a minimal .gitleaks.toml allowlist to reduce false positives, smallest change is adding the config, target and CI step; scope security hygiene; low risk; DoD includes make secrets passing locally on a clean tree, CI green with no new leaks, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all gates green, peer review completed, verification by committing a fake test secret in a branch to observe CI fail then removing it restores green, rollback by reverting the config and CI step.

* [ ] Standardize all Bash scripts under scripts to use env bash shebang and strict mode set -euo pipefail and add a make shellcheck target with a minimal configuration plus a CI step to run it, because several scripts currently lack pipefail or only set -u which weakens detection of failures; smallest change is editing script headers, adding one Makefile target, and a short workflow step; scope scripts, Makefile, CI; low risk; DoD includes an initial failing run then passing with zero shellcheck warnings, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by running shellcheck locally and observing CI green, rollback by reverting the script, Makefile, and workflow edits.

## Review 2025-08-14
* [ ] Add a make sbom target that uses syft (or cyclonedx-gomod as a fallback if syft is unavailable) to produce a CycloneDX SBOM at reports/sbom.json from the current module and wire it into the release workflow to upload as an asset, because the repo currently lacks an SBOM which weakens supply-chain visibility; smallest change is adding one Makefile target and a short CI step with a docs sentence; scope Makefile and CI; low risk; DoD includes failing first when the tool is missing then passing with deterministic output on a clean clone, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, backward compatibility preserved, peer review completed, verification by running make sbom locally and seeing reports/sbom.json and by confirming the asset on a tagged release, rollback by reverting the Makefile and workflow edits.
