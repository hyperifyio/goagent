* [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI to enforce quality gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs on push/PR that set up Go 1.21+, cache modules, run `make lint`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, and `make build build-tools`; upload `bin/agentcli` as an artifact; set `permissions: contents: read` and fail the build on any non-zero step; matrix over `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` Ã— `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.

## Review 2025-08-14
* [ ] Add docs/README.md as a short index and navigation for the docs tree with cross links to docs/adr/0001-minimal-agent-cli.md and docs/diagrams/agentcli-seq.md, smallest change is creating the index and adding links from the top level README and ADR, scope limited to documentation, low risk and independent, DoD includes tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, build reproducible, static analysis type checks formatting linting security scanning and secret detection all green, backward compatibility unaffected, docs updated in the same change, at least one peer review completed and linked, verification by rendering links on GitHub, rollback by reverting the file and cross links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/210.
* [ ] Write docs/architecture/module-boundaries.md to define allowed imports and layering between cmd internal/oai internal/tools and tools binaries, include a simple Mermaid diagram and guidance for adding new packages, smallest change is adding this single document and linking it from docs/README.md and README, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all quality gates green backward compatibility preserved docs and changelog updated as needed peer review completed verification by rendering diagram on GitHub and checking links rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/211.
* [ ] Create docs/reference/tools-manifest.md that precisely documents the tools.json schema required and optional fields validation rules examples and common mistakes and how schemas are exposed to the model, smallest change is a focused reference page and links from README usage and ADR-0001, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes examples runnable locally tests unchanged and green all quality gates green backward compatibility unaffected peer review completed verification by running example commands and rendering on GitHub rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/212.
* [ ] Add docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md mapping each quality gate to exact local commands and expected outputs for lint vet fmt unit and integration tests and coverage including a note on fixing golangci-lint not found by adding the Go bin directory to PATH, smallest change is one runbook file and a link from README Tests, low risk, DoD includes commands verified from a clean clone tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all gates green in CI peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/213.
* [ ] Document the release process in docs/releasing.md including tagging artifact naming checksums and verification and rollback guidance aligned with the planned release workflow, smallest change is a single page and links from README and the future release workflow, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes dry run steps validated locally without publishing tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by executing the documented commands in dry run rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/214.
* [ ] Author docs/security/threat-model.md expanding on trust boundaries untrusted model output handling tool containment recommendations secrets handling logging and redaction expectations and audit considerations, smallest change is adding this page and linking it from README Security model, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes tests unchanged and green all quality gates green backward compatibility unaffected peer review completed verification by reviewing content accuracy and link rendering rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/215.
* [ ] Provide docs/runbooks/troubleshooting.md covering common errors and fixes including missing tool binaries repo relative path violations tool timeouts HTTP errors and golangci-lint installation path with copy paste commands, smallest change is adding this runbook and linking from README Troubleshooting, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes steps verified on a clean clone tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/216.
