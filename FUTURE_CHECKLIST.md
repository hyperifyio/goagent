* [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI to enforce quality gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs on push/PR that set up Go 1.21+, cache modules, run `make lint`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, and `make build build-tools`; upload `bin/agentcli` as an artifact; set `permissions: contents: read` and fail the build on any non-zero step; matrix over `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` × `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.
* [ ] Add docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md mapping each quality gate to exact local commands and expected outputs for lint vet fmt unit and integration tests and coverage including a note on fixing golangci-lint not found by adding the Go bin directory to PATH, smallest change is one runbook file and a link from README Tests, low risk, DoD includes commands verified from a clean clone tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all gates green in CI peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/213.
* [ ] Document the release process in docs/releasing.md including tagging artifact naming checksums and verification and rollback guidance aligned with the planned release workflow, smallest change is a single page and links from README and the future release workflow, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes dry run steps validated locally without publishing tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by executing the documented commands in dry run rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/214.
* [ ] Make lint resilient when golangci-lint is not on PATH by invoking $(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint as a fallback after go install and/or extending PATH within the recipe because a clean clone currently fails make lint with command not found; smallest change is editing the Makefile lint recipe only; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD includes running make lint successfully on a clean machine without preinstalled linter, go vet and fmtcheck still enforced, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green with no new findings, peer review completed, verification by reproducing success on a fresh shell, rollback by reverting the Makefile change.

## Review 2025-08-14
* [ ] Rename the tools exec directory to match tests and build scripts by changing the current tools/execcli directory to tools/exec and updating the Makefile build-tools rule accordingly, because go test ./... and make build-tools both fail with “directory not found” for tools/exec; smallest change is a directory rename and Makefile edit only; scope tools and Makefile; low risk; DoD includes a focused failing test first where feasible then passing after the change, no coverage regression, deterministic tests green locally and in CI, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, make build-tools succeeds from a clean clone, README exec example works end to end, peer review completed, verification by reproducing the previous failures and observing success, rollback by reverting the rename and Makefile edit.
* [ ] Restore missing tool program directories for fs_append_file, fs_write_file, fs_move and fs_rm under the tools folder to align with existing tests and README examples (current failures show go test build steps erroring with “directory not found” for these paths), choosing restoration to the expected paths used by tests rather than changing tests for minimal impact; scope tools only; moderate risk due to multiple binaries; DoD includes test-driven changes with failing tests first then passing, no coverage regression, deterministic tests green locally and in CI, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, make build-tools and go test ./... succeed from a clean clone, README examples for these tools execute successfully, peer review completed, verification by running the specific tool tests and examples, rollback by reverting the added directories.
* [ ] Restore missing tools fs_search program directory to satisfy existing fs_search tests and the Makefile build target because go test ./... currently fails with directory not found for tools/fs_search, smallest change is reintroducing a minimal main under tools fs_search consistent with prior behavior defined by S01 to S04 while leaving truncation S05 as a separate task, scope limited to tools, low risk and independent, DoD requires failing test first where feasible then passing with no coverage regression deterministic offline tests green locally and in CI all quality gates green including vet format golangci-lint static analysis security scanning and secret detection with no new findings backward compatibility preserved docs updated only if references changed at least one peer review completed verification by running go test ./... and make build-tools from a clean clone and observing success rollback by reverting the added directory and files.
