* [ ] Switch submodule URLs in .gitmodules from SSH to HTTPS to simplify CI clones without SSH keys (public submodules .cursor/rules and scripts), smallest change is editing .gitmodules and running git submodule sync; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes actions/checkout with submodules enabled succeeding in a new CI workflow, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by observing CI clone success without extra SSH setup and local git submodule update --init works, rollback by reverting the .gitmodules change and syncing.
* [ ] Strengthen the Makefile test target to run go test -race -cover ./... and write a coverage profile under bin/coverage.out so local testing matches planned CI gates, smallest change is editing the Makefile test recipe only; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD includes running make test from a clean clone succeeds with race detector enabled and coverage file produced, tests otherwise unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green with no new findings, peer review completed, verification by observing race-enabled run and generated coverage file, rollback by reverting the Makefile edit.
* [ ] Add a make vuln target that installs and runs govulncheck ./... and wire it into CI after unit tests to fail builds on known vulnerabilities, smallest change is adding the target in the Makefile and a CI step once workflows exist; scope security scanning; low risk; DoD includes make vuln passing locally on a clean tree, CI green with the new step and no new findings, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all gates green, peer review completed, verification by introducing a known vulnerable transient dependency in a branch to see CI fail then removing it restores green, rollback by reverting the Makefile and CI edits.
* [ ] Add secret detection with gitleaks via a make secrets target and a CI step using the official action with a minimal .gitleaks.toml allowlist to reduce false positives, smallest change is adding the config, target and CI step; scope security hygiene; low risk; DoD includes make secrets passing locally on a clean tree, CI green with no new leaks, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all gates green, peer review completed, verification by committing a fake test secret in a branch to observe CI fail then removing it restores green, rollback by reverting the config and CI step.
* [ ] Standardize all Bash scripts under scripts to use env bash shebang and strict mode set -euo pipefail and add a make shellcheck target with a minimal configuration plus a CI step to run it, because several scripts currently lack pipefail or only set -u which weakens detection of failures; smallest change is editing script headers, adding one Makefile target, and a short workflow step; scope scripts, Makefile, CI; low risk; DoD includes an initial failing run then passing with zero shellcheck warnings, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by running shellcheck locally and observing CI green, rollback by reverting the script, Makefile, and workflow edits.
* [ ] CI smoke job for tools — workflow builds tools, runs each binary with sample stdin, and runs an agent loop against a fake API; no external network dependence; DoD: green in PRs, artifacts attached, linked to issue.
* [ ] Add docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md mapping each quality gate to exact local commands and expected outputs for lint vet fmt unit and integration tests and coverage including a note on fixing golangci-lint not found by adding the Go bin directory to PATH, smallest change is one runbook file and a link from README Tests, low risk, DoD includes commands verified from a clean clone tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all gates green in CI peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/213.
* [ ] Document the release process in docs/releasing.md including tagging artifact naming checksums and verification and rollback guidance aligned with the planned release workflow, smallest change is a single page and links from README and the future release workflow, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes dry run steps validated locally without publishing tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by executing the documented commands in dry run rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/214.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` × `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Add a make sbom target that uses syft (or cyclonedx-gomod as a fallback if syft is unavailable) to produce a CycloneDX SBOM at reports/sbom.json from the current module and wire it into the release workflow to upload as an asset, because the repo currently lacks an SBOM which weakens supply-chain visibility; smallest change is adding one Makefile target and a short CI step with a docs sentence; scope Makefile and CI; low risk; DoD includes failing first when the tool is missing then passing with deterministic output on a clean clone, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, backward compatibility preserved, peer review completed, verification by running make sbom locally and seeing reports/sbom.json and by confirming the asset on a tagged release, rollback by reverting the Makefile and workflow edits.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add GitHub Dependabot at .github/dependabot.yml to update Go modules weekly and GitHub Actions monthly so dependencies and CI actions stay current with minimal noise; smallest change is committing a single dependabot.yml file; scope repository hygiene; low risk and independent; DoD includes Dependabot PRs opening on schedule with passing CI and no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, lint, security and secret detection) with no new findings, peer review completed; verification by observing the first PRs or running a local preview, rollback by removing the configuration file.

* [ ] Create ADR-0003 “Toolchain & Lint Policy (Go + golangci-lint)” documenting that CI must use the Go version declared by `go.mod` and that `golangci-lint` is pinned to a known-good version for that Go line; include upgrade policy (bump both together via PR), risks, and rollback. Smallest change: add `docs/adr/0003-toolchain-and-lint-policy.md` with context, options, decision, consequences, and a link to the canonical issue URL (created in this PR). DoD: ADR rendered on GitHub, linked from `docs/README.md` and `README.md` (Tooling section); all gates green; one peer review completed.
* [ ] Pin CI to module Go version using `actions/setup-go` with `go-version-file: go.mod`. Smallest change: edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to configure `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version-file: go.mod` in every job (linux/macos/windows), print `go version` for traceability, and keep the existing matrix. DoD: a fresh CI run shows the same Go major.minor on all OSes (visible in logs), `make tidy lint test build build-tools` pass, gates green, peer review completed, rollback by reverting the workflow hunk.
* [ ] Add `make check-go-version` that fails early if the active toolchain doesn’t match `go.mod`. Smallest change: in `Makefile`, add target that extracts `MOD_GO=$$(awk '/^go [0-9]+\\.[0-9]+/ {print $$2; exit}' go.mod)` and `SYS_GO=$$(go version | sed -E 's/.*go([0-9]+\\.[0-9]+).*/\\1/')`; compare and `exit 2` with a clear message if different. Document this target briefly in `README.md` under “Developer workflow”. DoD: running `make check-go-version` passes when versions match and fails with an actionable message when mismatched; CI invokes it (temporarily from a one-off verification commit) and stays green; peer review completed.
* [ ] Ensure `check-go-version` is enforced in CI and locally by wiring it into `make lint`. Smallest change: prepend `$(MAKE) check-go-version` in the `lint` recipe before any linter runs. DoD: `make lint` fails fast on version drift (manual test by temporarily exporting an older/newer Go on a dev machine), passes otherwise; CI shows the check executed before golangci-lint; all gates green; peer review completed.
* [ ] Pin `golangci-lint` deterministically and install to a known path. Smallest change: in `Makefile`, add `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION ?= v1.60.3` and `GOBIN ?= $(CURDIR)/bin`; an `install-golangci` target runs `curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(GOBIN) $(GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION)`; update `lint` to call `$(GOBIN)/golangci-lint run` (no PATH assumptions). Add a short note to `README.md` and `docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md` explaining the pin and location. DoD: on a clean machine `make lint` installs the pinned version into `./bin` and runs successfully; CI is green on all OSes; peer review completed; rollback by reverting `Makefile` and doc changes.
* [ ] Add `make lint-precheck` to fail fast on analyzer/export-data mismatches. Smallest change: implement a shell precheck used by `lint` that (1) validates `$(GOBIN)/golangci-lint` exists, (2) extracts `GCL=$$($(GOBIN)/golangci-lint version | sed -nE 's/.*version ([v0-9\\.]+).*/\\1/p')`, (3) compares against `MIN=v1.60.0` using `sort -V`, and (4) prints an explicit hint if too old: “golangci-lint $GCL < $MIN with Go \$\$(go version)… update GOLANGCI\_LINT\_VERSION”. DoD: with a forced older version, `make lint` fails before analysis with the hint; with the pinned version, it proceeds; CI green; peer review completed.
* [ ] Make CI use **only** the Makefile-pinned linter (no separate action). Smallest change: ensure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` removes any `golangci-lint-action` steps and runs `make lint` instead; cache `~/go/pkg/mod` as today; no additional caches required. DoD: CI green across OSes, logs show our pinned version and `lint-precheck` execution, peer review completed; rollback by restoring the action step.
* [ ] Document and operationalize the specific failure mode you hit: “goanalysis\_metalinter: … internal/goarch (unsupported version: 2)”. Smallest change: add a subsection to `docs/runbooks/troubleshooting.md` and `docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md` titled “golangci-lint: unsupported export data (internal/goarch version: 2)” with exact symptoms, cause (Go/golangci-lint mismatch), and the resolution steps: run `make check-go-version`, ensure ADR-0003 policy, run `make install-golangci`, rerun `make lint`. DoD: docs render on GitHub, copy-paste commands verified on a clean clone, CI green, peer review completed.
* [ ] (Contingency, removable later) Add a temporary CI lint job that runs with Go 1.23.x if the pinned linter still fails on 1.24.x; tests and build jobs stay on `go-version-file: go.mod`. Smallest change: duplicate the `lint` job as `lint-compat`, set `actions/setup-go@v5` `go-version: "1.23.x"`, run `make lint`, mark with a TODO comment referencing the issue to remove once ADR-0003 policy is fully green with 1.24.x. DoD: CI green with both lint jobs; issue description captures the intent to delete this path; peer review completed; rollback by deleting the `lint-compat` job.
* [ ] Add a one-shot verifier in CI that prints versions for traceability. Smallest change: in the `lint` job, after setup and install, run `go version && $(GOBIN)/golangci-lint version` and emit them as step outputs (name the step “toolchain-versions”); no functional changes. DoD: CI logs show versions on all OSes; no gate regressions; peer review completed.
