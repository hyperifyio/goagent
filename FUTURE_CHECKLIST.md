* [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI to enforce quality gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs on push/PR that set up Go 1.21+, cache modules, run `make lint`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, and `make build build-tools`; upload `bin/agentcli` as an artifact; set `permissions: contents: read` and fail the build on any non-zero step; matrix over `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` Ã— `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.

## Review 2025-08-14
* [ ] Add docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md mapping each quality gate to exact local commands and expected outputs for lint vet fmt unit and integration tests and coverage including a note on fixing golangci-lint not found by adding the Go bin directory to PATH, smallest change is one runbook file and a link from README Tests, low risk, DoD includes commands verified from a clean clone tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all gates green in CI peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/213.
* [ ] Document the release process in docs/releasing.md including tagging artifact naming checksums and verification and rollback guidance aligned with the planned release workflow, smallest change is a single page and links from README and the future release workflow, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes dry run steps validated locally without publishing tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by executing the documented commands in dry run rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/214.
