* [x] Ensure `check-go-version` is enforced in CI and locally by wiring it into `make lint`. Smallest change: prepend `$(MAKE) check-go-version` in the `lint` recipe before any linter runs. DoD: `make lint` fails fast on version drift (manual test by temporarily exporting an older/newer Go on a dev machine), passes otherwise; CI shows the check executed before golangci-lint; all gates green; peer review completed.
      - [x] [S02a1c0:l252-ci-push-preflight-blocked] Preflight on this headless runner indicates GitHub authentication is missing. Next step: on a browser-capable host run `gh auth login -h github.com --git-protocol ssh --scopes admin:public_key --device`, verify `ssh -T git@github.com` greets successfully, then execute `scripts/ci_push_pr.sh`. Capture the PR and CI run URLs and verify lint logs show `check-go-version: OK` before `golangci-lint version` across the matrix.
    - [x] [S02u0a1b:l252-gh-device-login-blocked] Preflight on this runner shows `gh auth status` invalid token, `git_protocol=ssh`, `ssh -T git@github.com` fails with publickey, and `GH_TOKEN` absent. Next: on a machine with a browser, run `gh auth login -h github.com --git-protocol ssh --scopes admin:public_key --device`, complete the device flow, then re-run `gh auth status -h github.com` and proceed to add the SSH key.
    - [x] [S02u0a1c0:l252-gh-device-login-web-preflight] Verified local gates are green (go test, make lint), `gh auth status -h github.com` reports invalid/absent token and `gh config get -h github.com git_protocol` is `ssh`; blocked awaiting browser-based device flow on a capable host. Next: perform the device-flow login on a browser host per S02u0a1c, then return to verify and proceed to add the SSH key.
    - [x] [S02a1b0:l252-ci-green-auth-blocked-preflight] Local gates green (go test, make lint); authentication remains absent on this headless host. Recorded BLOCKED state and next step in `logs/coding.log` and `logs/gh_auth_status.*`. Next: complete device-flow login on a browser-capable machine, add SSH key, verify `ssh -T git@github.com`, then push branch and open PR to trigger CI.
    - [x] [S02u1:l252-ssh-keygen] Generate an SSH key pair and surface the public key for account enrollment; DoD: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` exists, fingerprint recorded in `logs/coding.log`, and instructions included to add the key via GitHub Web or `gh ssh-key add` so a subsequent `ssh -T git@github.com` can succeed.
  - [x] [S11:l252-ci-skeleton-file] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (new) containing a single job `lint-test-build` with a step named exactly `lint (includes check-go-version)` that runs `make tidy && make lint | tee lint.log` and a subsequent step named exactly `Assert lint order (check-go-version before golangci-lint)` that compares line numbers of `^check-go-version: OK` and `^golangci-lint version` in `lint.log` (fail if absent or out of order); DoD: `go test ./internal/ci -run TestLintOrderLocallyAndInWorkflow` passes locally reading the workflow file and finding both expected step names.
  - [x] [S12:l252-ci-matrix-gover] Expand the workflow to a matrix over `{ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest}` and use `actions/setup-go@v5` with `go-version-file: go.mod` in the `lint-test-build` job; DoD: workflow syntax validates, unit test still passes, and a PR run shows the same Go major.minor across OSes in logs.
  - [x] [S13:l252-windows-install-rg] Add a Windows-only step before lint to install ripgrep (e.g., `choco install ripgrep -y`) so `make lint`’s `check-tools-paths`/`verify-manifest-paths` do not fail due to `ensure-rg`’s Linux/macOS-only installer; DoD: on `windows-latest`, the `lint (includes check-go-version)` step completes and finds `rg` on PATH.
  - [x] [S14:l252-windows-shell-bash] For `windows-latest`, force GNU bash for all `run` steps that invoke `make` (set `defaults.run.shell: bash` at the job level or `shell: bash` per step) to satisfy Makefile’s bashisms and `SHELL := /bin/bash`; DoD: Windows lint step executes successfully without PowerShell/`/bin/sh` path errors, and the unit test remains green.
* [x] Add `make lint-precheck` to fail fast on analyzer/export-data mismatches. Smallest change: implement a shell precheck used by `lint` that (1) validates `$(GOBIN)/golangci-lint` exists, (2) extracts `GCL=$$($(GOBIN)/golangci-lint version | sed -nE 's/.*version ([v0-9\\.]+).*/\\1/p')`, (3) compares against `MIN=v1.60.0` using `sort -V`, and (4) prints an explicit hint if too old: “golangci-lint $GCL < $MIN with Go \$\$(go version)… update GOLANGCI\_LINT\_VERSION”. DoD: with a forced older version, `make lint` fails before analysis with the hint; with the pinned version, it proceeds; CI green; peer review completed.
* [ ] Strengthen the Makefile test target to run go test -race -cover ./... and write a coverage profile under bin/coverage.out so local testing matches planned CI gates, smallest change is editing the Makefile test recipe only; scope Makefile; low risk; DoD includes running make test from a clean clone succeeds with race detector enabled and coverage file produced, tests otherwise unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green with no new findings, peer review completed, verification by observing race-enabled run and generated coverage file, rollback by reverting the Makefile edit.
* [ ] Switch submodule URLs in .gitmodules from SSH to HTTPS to simplify CI clones without SSH keys (public submodules .cursor/rules and scripts), smallest change is editing .gitmodules and running git submodule sync; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes actions/checkout with submodules enabled succeeding in a new CI workflow, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by observing CI clone success without extra SSH setup and local git submodule update --init works, rollback by reverting the .gitmodules change and syncing.
* [ ] Add a make vuln target that installs and runs govulncheck ./... and wire it into CI after unit tests to fail builds on known vulnerabilities, smallest change is adding the target in the Makefile and a CI step once workflows exist; scope security scanning; low risk; DoD includes make vuln passing locally on a clean tree, CI green with the new step and no new findings, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all gates green, peer review completed, verification by introducing a known vulnerable transient dependency in a branch to see CI fail then removing it restores green, rollback by reverting the Makefile and CI edits.
* [ ] Add secret detection with gitleaks via a make secrets target and a CI step using the official action with a minimal .gitleaks.toml allowlist to reduce false positives, smallest change is adding the config, target and CI step; scope security hygiene; low risk; DoD includes make secrets passing locally on a clean tree, CI green with no new leaks, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all gates green, peer review completed, verification by committing a fake test secret in a branch to observe CI fail then removing it restores green, rollback by reverting the config and CI step.
* [ ] Standardize all Bash scripts under scripts to use env bash shebang and strict mode set -euo pipefail and add a make shellcheck target with a minimal configuration plus a CI step to run it, because several scripts currently lack pipefail or only set -u which weakens detection of failures; smallest change is editing script headers, adding one Makefile target, and a short workflow step; scope scripts, Makefile, CI; low risk; DoD includes an initial failing run then passing with zero shellcheck warnings, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed, verification by running shellcheck locally and observing CI green, rollback by reverting the script, Makefile, and workflow edits.
* [ ] CI smoke job for tools — workflow builds tools, runs each binary with sample stdin, and runs an agent loop against a fake API; no external network dependence; DoD: green in PRs, artifacts attached, linked to issue.
* [ ] Add GitHub CodeQL code scanning for Go by committing .github/workflows/codeql.yml using the official CodeQL action with default queries on push and pull_request so security analysis runs automatically; evidence: no CodeQL workflow exists today; scope .github/workflows only; low risk and independent; DoD: CodeQL job runs green with zero new alerts, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, gofmt, golangci-lint, staticcheck, security and secret detection) with no new findings, peer review completed; verify by viewing the Security > Code scanning alerts page and the workflow run logs; rollback by deleting the workflow file.
* [ ] Document the release process in docs/releasing.md including tagging artifact naming checksums and verification and rollback guidance aligned with the planned release workflow, smallest change is a single page and links from README and the future release workflow, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes dry run steps validated locally without publishing tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by executing the documented commands in dry run rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/214.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` × `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Add a make sbom target that uses syft (or cyclonedx-gomod as a fallback if syft is unavailable) to produce a CycloneDX SBOM at reports/sbom.json from the current module and wire it into the release workflow to upload as an asset, because the repo currently lacks an SBOM which weakens supply-chain visibility; smallest change is adding one Makefile target and a short CI step with a docs sentence; scope Makefile and CI; low risk; DoD includes failing first when the tool is missing then passing with deterministic output on a clean clone, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, golangci-lint, static analysis, security and secret scans) with no new findings, backward compatibility preserved, peer review completed, verification by running make sbom locally and seeing reports/sbom.json and by confirming the asset on a tagged release, rollback by reverting the Makefile and workflow edits.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add GitHub Dependabot at .github/dependabot.yml to update Go modules weekly and GitHub Actions monthly so dependencies and CI actions stay current with minimal noise; smallest change is committing a single dependabot.yml file; scope repository hygiene; low risk and independent; DoD includes Dependabot PRs opening on schedule with passing CI and no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, format, lint, security and secret detection) with no new findings, peer review completed; verification by observing the first PRs or running a local preview, rollback by removing the configuration file.
* [ ] Add CODEOWNERS at .github/CODEOWNERS to automatically request reviews from maintainers; smallest change is committing one CODEOWNERS file mapping paths to the maintainers team; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes PRs auto-requesting reviews from owners, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verify by opening a test pull request and observing requested reviewers; rollback by removing the CODEOWNERS file.
* [ ] Add SECURITY.md under .github with a concise vulnerability disclosure policy including contact, supported versions, and response expectations, and link it from README; smallest change is a single Markdown file and one README sentence; scope security documentation; low risk; DoD includes the GitHub Security tab surfacing the policy, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verify by visiting the repository Security page, rollback by removing the file and README link.
* [ ] Add pull request template at .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md prompting for canonical issue URL, intent, Definition of Done checklist, and test plan; smallest change is committing one template file; scope contribution workflow; low risk; DoD includes new pull requests prefilled with the template, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verify by opening a draft pull request and seeing the template, rollback by removing the template file.
* [ ] Add issue templates at .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml and .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml plus config.yml to disable blank issues; smallest change is committing two minimal YAML templates and one config; scope issue hygiene; low risk; DoD includes the New issue page showing the templates with required fields, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verify by clicking New issue and observing the choices, rollback by removing the templates.
* [ ] OBSOLETE: Add GitHub CodeQL code scanning for Go by committing .github/workflows/codeql.yml using the official CodeQL action with default queries on push and pull_request so security analysis runs automatically; evidence: no CodeQL workflow exists today; scope .github/workflows only; low risk and independent; DoD: CodeQL job runs green with zero new alerts, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green (vet, gofmt, golangci-lint, staticcheck, security and secret detection) with no new findings, peer review completed; verify by viewing the Security > Code scanning alerts page and the workflow run logs; rollback by deleting the workflow file.
* [ ] Add jq to README Installation prerequisites with OS-specific install snippets (apt, brew, choco) because README examples and runbooks pipe tool output to jq but prerequisites omit it; smallest change is editing README only; scope documentation; low risk and independent; DoD: README renders correctly on GitHub, examples run from a clean clone with jq installed, tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verify by executing one README example end-to-end with jq and observing the pretty-printed JSON; rollback by reverting the README edit.
* [ ] Upload coverage profile and summary in CI by attaching bin/coverage.out as an artifact and printing total coverage using go tool cover func; smallest change is adding two steps in .github/workflows/ci.yml after the test step; scope CI; low risk; depends on the Makefile test target producing a coverage profile as already planned; DoD includes CI artifacts containing coverage.out and logs showing total coverage percentage, tests otherwise unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, peer review completed; verify by inspecting CI artifacts and logs, rollback by removing the new steps.
Blocked: SSH handshake fails with "Permission denied (publickey)"; next step is to configure GitHub authentication (add SSH key or run gh auth login with write access), then push this branch and open a PR to trigger CI and capture the run URL for verification.
Next: authenticate the GitHub CLI for github.com using device flow with SSH protocol and admin:public_key scope, add the existing SSH public key to the account, verify ssh -T git@github.com succeeds, then push the branch and open a PR to trigger CI.
* [ ] Document and operationalize the specific failure mode you hit: “golangci-lint: unsupported export data (internal/goarch version: 2)”. Smallest change: add a subsection to `docs/runbooks/troubleshooting.md` and `docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md` titled exactly that with symptoms, cause (Go/golangci-lint mismatch), and the resolution steps: run `make check-go-version`, ensure ADR-0003 policy, run `make install-golangci`, rerun `make lint`. DoD: docs render on GitHub, steps verified, CI green, peer review completed.
* [ ] (Contingency, removable later) Add a temporary CI lint job that runs with Go 1.23.x if the pinned linter still fails on 1.24.x; tests and build jobs stay on `go-version-file: go.mod`. Smallest change: duplicate the `lint` job as `lint-compat`, set `actions/setup-go@v5` `go-version: "1.23.x"`, run `make lint`, mark with a TODO comment referencing the issue to remove once ADR-0003 policy is fully green with 1.24.x. DoD: CI green with both lint jobs; issue description captures the intent to delete this path; peer review completed; rollback by deleting the `lint-compat` job.
* [ ] Add a one-shot verifier in CI that prints versions for traceability. Smallest change: in the `lint` job, after setup and install, run `go version && $(GOBIN)/golangci-lint version` and emit them as step outputs (name the step “toolchain-versions”); no functional changes. DoD: CI logs show versions on all OSes; no gate regressions; peer review completed.
* [x] Add Windows/macOS/Linux path tests for `save.dir` correctness and SHA-256 reporting (use `tools/testutil/MakeRepoRelTempDir`), and verify image bytes are identical to decoded b64; DoD: platform-agnostic tests green across CI matrix.
  - [x] [S11:adr-0006-file] Create `docs/adr/0006-image-generation-tool-img_create.md` documenting `img_create` (Context/Decision/Consequences) with explicit links to `tools/cmd/img_create/img_create.go`, `docs/reference/img_create.md`, `internal/tools/manifest.go`, `internal/tools/runner.go`, and `docs/diagrams/toolbelt-seq.md`; include security/envPassthrough and transcript‑hygiene rationale; DoD: file renders on GitHub and all relative links resolve.
  - [x] [S12:docs-index-adr-0006] Add ADR‑0006 entry to `docs/README.md` under ADRs with link `adr/0006-image-generation-tool-img_create.md`; DoD: link clickable and resolves in GitHub UI.
  - [ ] [S18:verify-docs-ci-0006] Run `go test ./...` and `make lint`; verify ADR‑0006 links render and resolve via GitHub preview; DoD: tests/lint green and all links verified.

## Review 2025-08-18
* [ ] Add Windows ripgrep install snippet to README Developer prerequisites (Chocolatey: choco install ripgrep -y) because README currently lists apt/brew only and local Windows developers hit ensure-rg unsupported OS; smallest change is adding a Windows bullet; scope documentation only; low risk and independent; DoD includes README rendering with the new Windows example, local Windows setup succeeds (rg --version prints) and make lint/test remain green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green; verify by following the snippet on a Windows dev machine; rollback by reverting the README edit.

## New tools


## Review 2025-08-18
* [ ] Deduplicate the duplicated CodeQL checklist entry in FUTURE_CHECKLIST.md by deleting one of the two identical lines so only a single CodeQL task remains; smallest change is to remove one duplicate line; scope documentation hygiene limited to FUTURE_CHECKLIST.md; low risk and independent; DoD includes the file showing only one unchecked CodeQL task, tests and lint unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, verification by searching the file and observing exactly one CodeQL line, rollback by reverting the edit
* [ ] Add a Windows make installation snippet to the README developer prerequisites using Chocolatey choco install make -y because README uses make commands but Windows setup omits this requirement; smallest change is adding one Windows bullet near the ripgrep and golangci-lint instructions; scope documentation only; low risk; DoD includes README rendering correctly and a successful make --version and make lint test build on a Windows environment with all quality gates green and no coverage regression, verification by running make --version and executing a sample make target on windows-latest, rollback by reverting the README edit
* [ ] Ignore generated image outputs by adding assets/ to .gitignore so img_create examples do not accidentally commit large binaries; smallest change is appending a single ignore entry under a clear comment; scope .gitignore only; low risk and independent; DoD includes saving an output under assets then seeing git status clean, tests and lint unchanged and green with no coverage regression, all quality gates green, verification by creating an image under assets and observing no tracked changes, rollback by removing the ignore entry
