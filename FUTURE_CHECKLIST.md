* [ ] Configure GitHub Actions CI to enforce quality gates: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with jobs on push/PR that set up Go 1.21+, cache modules, run `make lint`, `go test -race -cover ./...`, and `make build build-tools`; upload `bin/agentcli` as an artifact; set `permissions: contents: read` and fail the build on any non-zero step; matrix over `os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]`.
* [ ] Add release workflow for static binaries and checksums: `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered on tags like `v*`; build `agentcli` for `linux,darwin,windows` × `amd64,arm64` with `CGO_ENABLED=0`; name outputs `agentcli_<os>_<arch>` (Windows `.exe`); generate `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.sig` (optional GPG); create GitHub Release and upload artifacts and checksums; document in README how to download and verify.
* [ ] Tag and publish `v0.1.0` once CI is green and docs/tests are complete: ensure `README.md` has usage, examples, and limitations (no streaming, sequential tool calls only); ADR-0001 and sequence diagram present; unit and integration tests passing; create annotated tag `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "MVP non-interactive agent CLI with OpenAI-compatible tools"` and `git push --tags`.
* [ ] Add lint/type checks and formatting gates: include `.golangci.yml` enabling `govet`, `gofmt`, `errcheck`, `staticcheck`, `gocyclo` (with reasonable thresholds), `gosimple`; add `make lint` that installs `golangci-lint` if missing and runs it; ensure `go vet ./...` and `gofmt -s -l` produce no output; fail CI if any lints fail.
* [ ] Add docs/operations/ci-quality-gates.md mapping each quality gate to exact local commands and expected outputs for lint vet fmt unit and integration tests and coverage including a note on fixing golangci-lint not found by adding the Go bin directory to PATH, smallest change is one runbook file and a link from README Tests, low risk, DoD includes commands verified from a clean clone tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression all gates green in CI peer review completed verification by following steps locally rollback by reverting the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/213.
* [ ] Document the release process in docs/releasing.md including tagging artifact naming checksums and verification and rollback guidance aligned with the planned release workflow, smallest change is a single page and links from README and the future release workflow, scope documentation, low risk, DoD includes dry run steps validated locally without publishing tests unchanged and green all quality gates green peer review completed verification by executing the documented commands in dry run rollback by removing the doc and links, traceability https://github.com/hyperifyio/goagent/issues/214.

## Review 2025-08-14
* [ ] Reconcile minimum Go version by setting a single supported floor across go.mod and README.md (go.mod currently declares go 1.24.6 while README states Go 1.21+); smallest change is either lowering the go directive in go.mod to 1.21 to match docs or updating README (and future CI matrix) to 1.24+; scope limited to go.mod, docs, and CI config when added; low risk; DoD includes tests unchanged and green with no coverage regression, reproducible build, all quality gates green (vet/format/lint/security/secret detection) with no new findings, backward compatibility preserved, at least one peer review completed, verification by building on the declared floor version locally and in CI, rollback by reverting the version/doc change.
* [ ] Update README.md fs_mkdirp example to remove the outdated note “until aggregated in Makefile” and use the existing make build-tools step consistently; smallest change is editing that section only; scope documentation; low risk; DoD includes tests unchanged and green, all quality gates green, README renders correctly on GitHub, peer review completed, verification by running the example from a clean clone after make build build-tools, rollback by reverting the edit.
* [ ] Add built tool binaries under tools/ to .gitignore (e.g., tools/get_time, tools/exec, tools/fs_*, tools/fs_search) so make build-tools doesn’t produce noisy untracked files; smallest change is appending ignore patterns; scope repository hygiene; low risk; DoD includes tests unchanged and green, all gates green, verification by running make build-tools then git status shows no new untracked binaries, rollback by removing the ignore lines.
* [ ] Align the get_time tool contract across tools/timecli (expects {"timezone":"..."} and outputs {"timezone","iso8601"}), README.md (describes tz and unix seconds), and tools.json (declares required tz) by choosing one canonical schema (prefer timezone with optional alias tz) and updating code, tests, and docs accordingly; smallest change is adding a backward-compatible alias in code and adjusting docs/manifest; scope limited to this tool; low risk; DoD includes unit test covering both inputs and output fields, README quick start and tools.json updated, all quality gates green with no coverage regression, peer review completed, verification by running the quick start end-to-end, rollback by reverting the edits.
* [ ] Normalize API key environment variable naming across the repo to OAI_API_KEY (scripts like scripts/smoke-test.sh currently reference OPENAI_API_KEY) and document the canonical variable in README.md while keeping the old name as a fallback for compatibility; smallest change is updating the script to prefer OAI_API_KEY with OPENAI_API_KEY fallback and adjusting docs; scope small; low risk; DoD includes tests unchanged and green, all gates green, verification by running the script with only OAI_API_KEY set and observing successful auth header injection, rollback by reverting the script and doc changes.
